<div id='toverview' class='tabcontent'><h3 id='overview'>Overview</h3>
<p>This assignment will focus on the implementation of the RSA algorithm. Specifically, you will have to implement key generation, encryption and decryption, signing and signature checking, and cracking of RSA messages.</p>
<p>The intent is to implement this in or Python, as the langauge’s libraries provides the functionality to handle the necessary hashing and math. The installed version is 3.10. We have allowed Java in the past, but are deprecating that language, as it caused much more work for the students. You must speak to me first if you want to use another language! However, you will have to adapt the Python skeleton code for your desired language.</p>
<p>You will want to see the <a href='../uva/hw-policies.html'>homeworks policies page</a> (<a href='../uva/hw-policies.md'>md</a>) for formatting and other details. The due dates are listed on the <a href='../uva/index.html'>UVa course page</a> (<a href='../uva/index.md'>md</a>).</p>
<p>You should be familiar with how the RSA algorithm works from the <a href='../slides/encryption.html#/rsa'>the encryption lecture</a>. More details are available online (see the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)'>Wikipedia article on RSA</a>). Keep in mind, however, that the Wikipedia page uses different variable names than what the lecture and slide set used.  The Python code does not use anything beyond the <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/library/'>standard Python library</a>, specifically <code>hashlib</code> and <code>random</code>.</p>
</div><div id='tchangelog' class='tabcontent'><h3 id='changelog'>Changelog</h3>
<p>Any changes to this page will be put here for easy reference. Typo fixes and minor clarifications are not listed here. So far there aren’t any significant changes to report.</p>
</div><div id='tlinks' class='tabcontent'><h3 id='links'>Links</h3>
<p>These links are all described below, but are included here, all in one place.</p>
<ul>
<li>Python: The skeleton code is in the <a href='rsa/rsa.py'>rsa.py</a> file; you can see an HTML version of that code <a href='rsa/rsa.py.html'>here</a>.</li>

<h4 id='shell-script'>Shell script</h4>
<p>Since different programming languages can be used, and you may name your file differently, we are going to have you submit a shell script called <code>rsa.sh</code> that we will use to test your code. All it does is pass the command-line parameters on to your program. If you are using Python, then your shell script would look like the following:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
python3 rsa.py $@</code></pre>
<p>Be sure to call <code>python3</code>, not <code>python</code> in your shell script! Otherwise it will not work. And change <code>rsa.py</code> to the name of your program file.</p>

<p>Save the two lines above to a text file called <code>rsa.sh</code>; change the name of the file as appropriate to your code. Then run <code>chmod 755 rsa.sh</code>. You should then be able to run your program through the shell script. Examples of how to call the shell script are given below, but it uses the same command line parameters described above.</p>
<h4 id='makefile'>Makefile</h4>
<p>Separately from the shell script, you will also need a Makefile. This will allow your program to be compiled prior to execution (if your program needs compilation). For languages that do not need compilation (such as Python), just put in a single <code>echo</code> statement so that <code>make</code> still runs properly.</p>
<p>If you are using Python, your Makefile will look like the following:</p>
<pre><code>main:
     echo hello world</code></pre>
<p>Note that the indentation is a tab, not spaces! Makefiles are very strict on that.</p>

<p>Note that the indentation is a tab, not spaces! Makefiles are very strict on that. And change the Python file name as appropriate for your source code.</p>
<p>We realize that we are recommending Python, which does not require compilation, yet also requiring you to submit a Makefile. The reason is for those who decide to do it in another language that does require compilation.</p>
</div><div id='tcode' class='tabcontent'><h3 id='code'>Code</h3>
<p>To simplify the assignment, and to allow easy interoperability between your code and our test cases, we have provided a significant amount of skeleton code.</p>
<p>It is <strong>STRONGLY RECOMMENDED</strong> that you use Python for this assignment. The Java code to perform the necessary functions is much harder to code. In the past, most students who tried to use Java gave up and switched to Python. Even if you don’t know Python, it will still be easier than in any other language.</p>
<h4 id='python'>Python</h4>
<p>The skeleton code is in the <a href='rsa/rsa.py'>rsa.py</a> file; you can see an HTML version of that code <a href='rsa/rsa.py.html'>here</a>. It handles reading in the command-line parameters, and then will set global variables and call the appropriate functions. You still have to have your program perform the correct action based on the global variables and function calls.</p>

</div><div id='tdetails' class='tabcontent'><h3 id='details'>Details</h3>
<p>For this assignment, you must implement six methods in the RSA algorithm. They are the ones that state “requires completion” in the comments. This assignment is to be done in  Python (as you will need the functions in the standard Python library). You can use another language if you would like, but you need to check with the course staff – and at least 2 days are needed to ensure that the auto-grader works with that language.</p>
<p>You must start with the  <a href='rsa/rsa.py'>rsa.py</a> skeleton code (<a href='rsa/rsa.py.html'>HTML version</a>). This code, described more fully below, provides various methods to ensure that the format of the key files and the encrypted files are consistent, so that we may easily test your code. Furthermore, we are going to <em>EXPLICITLY</em> call individual methods from your code, so if they are not named exactly as they are therein, your code will fail those tests.</p>
<p>You need to use the provided <code>convertToASCII()</code> and <code>convertFromASCII()</code> methods in your code, specifically to convert the text for encryption and then back for the decryption.</p>
<p>You may add any other methods or fields that you would like to add. The following is required for our testing harness to work properly on your code:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>main()</code> method exactly as provided, as we want to make sure the command line parameters are interpreted the way we expect them to be interpreted</li>
<li>The six methods that you are to implement should not have their signatures changed (return type, visibility, static-ness, name, or parameter types). All these methods have <code>throws Exception</code> in case your implementation decides to throw an exception.</li>
<li>The two utility classes (<code>RSAKey</code> and <code>CipherText</code>) should not be modified</li>
<li>The utility methods, which are the six methods that you <em>don’t</em> have to implement, should not be modified. Those are: <code>writeKeyToFile()</code>, <code>readKeyFromFile()</code>, <code>readCipherTextFromFile()</code>, <code>writeCipherTextToFile()</code>, <code>getFileContents()</code>, and <code>convertHash()</code>.</li>
<li>As mentioned above, you may add any other methods or fields that you would like to add.</li>
</ul>
<p>These requirements are meant to allow for easy for interoperability, and to ensure that your code works with our test cases.</p>
<p>You must implement six methods within the  <a href='rsa/rsa.py'>rsa.py</a> skeleton code (<a href='rsa/rsa.py.html'>HTML version</a>) file. Those methods are: <code>generateKeys()</code>, <code>encrypt()</code>, <code>decrypt()</code>, <code>crack()</code>, <code>sign()</code>, and <code>checkSign()</code>. The code is well commented to get you started. Details for how they should work can be found in the <a href='../slides/encryption.html#/'>the encryption lecture</a> as well as <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA'>online</a>.</p>

</div><div id='tparameters' class='tabcontent'><h3 id='parameters'>Parameters</h3>
<p>The <code>main()</code> method should not need to be modified for the final submission (feel free to modify it any way you want to test your code). It will call the appropriate methods as indicated by the command line parameters, which are described below.  In almost all cases, output (progress, status messages, etc.) should ONLY be printed to the standard output if the <code>-verbose</code> option is set, and should be enough that we can understand what is happening. The <em>only</em> time output should be printed to the terminal is when (1) a signature does not match, and (2) an error condition is encountered (which, in theory, should not happen with our tests on properly implemented code).</p>
<p>Note that the command-line parameters are parsed <strong>in order</strong> - this means that if you call <code>./rsa.sh -keygen 10 -verbose</code>, you will not get any verbosity, as that parameter was specified <em>after</em> the <code>-keygen</code> parameter was given. We provide a <code>main()</code> method in the  <a href='rsa/rsa.py'>rsa.py</a> skeleton code (<a href='rsa/rsa.py.html'>HTML version</a>) skeleton code, which can handle the parameters and, again, that <code>main()</code> method <em>should not be modified</em>.</p>
<p>Note that normal operation (i.e. without the <code>-verbose</code> flag) is for it to print <em>nothing</em> - the only exception is the <code>-checksign</code> flag.</p>
<p>You may assume (and, in fact, should) that you will only receive one of <code>-encrypt</code>, <code>-decrypt</code>, <code>-sign</code>, <code>-checksign</code>, <code>-crack</code>, or <code>-keygen</code>; this specifies what the program is going to do. The program should not output any messages on normal execution (it should output error messages, as appropriate – but we won’t be giving any invalid combination of parameters) other than on <code>-checksign</code>. With the <code>-showpandq</code> option, it will of course output <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>. And with the <code>-verbose</code> option, it can output a lot of informational messages.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you may assume that we will not give you invalid input, either in the files we provide, or for the command-line parameters.</p>
<h4 id='the--showpandq-parameter'>The <code>-showpandq</code> parameter</h4>
<p>When this is provided, it should print both <span class='math inline'><em>p</em></span> and <span class='math inline'><em>q</em></span> on separate lines (first <span class='math inline'><em>p</em></span> and then <span class='math inline'><em>q</em></span>) as base-10 integers. For example:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./rsa.sh -showpandq -keygen 10
859
701
$</code></pre>
<h4 id='full-command-line-parameters'>Full command line parameters</h4>
<p>This is the full description of the command line parameters. These are already handled by the skeleton code provided. It is meant as a reference if you need clarification while working on your code – you can skip it for now.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-keygen &lt;bitsize&gt;</code>: this will generate RSA public/private keys of the specified bit size. The base name for the file to store the keys in will be specified by the <code>-key</code> parameter; see details below as to the file names and file format. You can divide by 3.321928, which is roughly log(10)/log(2), to get the number of decimal digits. The number of bits provided is for <em>p</em> (as well as <em>q</em>); <em>n</em> is roughly twice as many bits. Note that <em>d</em> and <em>e</em> need to be roughly the same bit size (i.e. you can’t have <em>e</em> be about the size of <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, and <em>d</em> be about the size of <em>n</em>). See the -key parameter, below, for how to write the key to a file.</li>
<li><code>-output &lt;filename&gt;</code>: this specifies the file name to save the results in. It can be the output from an encryption or decryption. The key file format is described in the <code>writeKeyToFile()</code> method. A encrypted message file will follow the format described in the <code>writeCipherTextToFile()</code> method. If not specified, it should default to “outut.txt”.</li>
<li><code>-input &lt;filename&gt;</code>: the input file to be used to encrypt, decrypt, sign, check the sign of, or crack. This input file is specifically the plaintext, cipher text, or the signature, depending on what function is being called. Note that the key would be specified by the <code>-key</code> parameter. If not specified, it should default to “input.txt”.</li>
<li><code>-showpandq</code>: this flag will cause the key generation to print out (to the screen only!) the values for the prime numbers <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> during the key generation phase - this is done for debugging purposes, and so we can check your code.</li>
<li><code>-key &lt;keyfile&gt;</code>: the key file. For encryption, this is the public key file; for decryption, this is the private key file; for key generation, the file name to write the keys to; for cracking a message, this specifies the public key file. Note that this only specifies the key prefix name (such as ‘alice’ or ‘bob’) - to get the full key name, <code>-private.key</code>, <code>-public.key</code>, or <code>-cracked-private.key</code> is appended to the name. If not specified, it should default to “key”.</li>
<li><code>-encrypt</code>: this will use the public key (specified by the <code>-key</code> parameter) and encrypt the plaintext file (specified by the <code>-input</code> parameter), writing the ciphertext to another file (specified by the <code>-output</code> parameter).</li>
<li><code>-decrypt</code>: this will use the private key (specified by the <code>-key</code> parameter) and encrypt the ciphertext file (specified by the <code>-input</code> parameter), writing the plaintext to another file (specified by the <code>-output</code> parameter).</li>
<li><code>-verbose</code>: this flag need not do anything, but is used for debugging: a normal execution should not output anything (unless the signature doesn’t match with <code>-checksign</code>); with this option, you can output all the status and debugging information that you would like.</li>
<li><code>-crack</code>: this will take the public key (specified by the <code>-key</code> parameter) and proceed to crack the RSA encryption by factoring <em>n</em> into <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>. The output key (<em>d</em>,<em>n</em>) is written to &lt;foo&gt;-cracked-private.key, where &lt;foo&gt; is specified by the <code>-key</code> parameter.</li>
<li><code>-sign</code>: this will sign a message; given the message (specified by <code>-input</code>) and the private key (specified by <code>-key</code>), it will write the RSA‐encrypted MD5 hash to the output file. We assume it writes the sign to a file called &lt;filename&gt;.sign, where &lt;filename&gt; is the name given to the <code>-input</code> parameter - this can overwrite the existing &lt;filename&gt;.sign, if it exists. A signature is just an encryption of the MD5 hash. </li>
<li><code>-checksign</code>: this will check a signed message; given the message (specified by <code>-input</code>) and the public key (specified by <code>-key</code>), it will verify the RSA encrypted MD5 hash to the signature file. Similar to the <code>-sign</code> parameter, the key is assumed to be in the &lt;filename&gt;.sign file. This will print “signatures do not match” (or similar) ONLY if the signatures do not match; if they do match, then nothing is printed.</li>
</ul>
</div><div id='ttesting' class='tabcontent'><h3 id='testing'>Testing</h3>
<p>A sample usage of the program, in which is Alice and Bob are sending messages is available. This code can be found in a shell script named <a href='rsa/test-rsa.sh'>test-rsa.sh</a> (<a href='rsa/test-rsa.sh.html'>HTML version</a>). If you are on a UNIX environment, run <code>chmod 755 test-rsa.sh</code>, and then run it via <code>./test-rsa.sh</code>. Note that this is not a complete test suite! Just a quick check to see if the basics work. But if your program does not work with this, then it’s incomplete, and will receive a low grade. If you are not on a UNIX system, then you may have to copy-and-paste those commands into a command terminal.</p>
<p>The script is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
# setup: create the message1.txt and message2.txt files
/bin/rm -f message[12].txt
echo "Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity;" &gt; message1.txt
echo "and I'm not sure about the the universe." &gt;&gt; message1.txt
echo "by Albert Einstein" &gt;&gt; message1.txt
echo "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog." &gt; message2.txt
# 1: create keys alice-public.key and alice-private.key
./rsa.sh -key alice -keygen 200
# 2: create keys bob-public.key and bob-private.key
./rsa.sh -key bob -keygen 200
# 3: alice is going to encrypt a message for bob
./rsa.sh -key bob -input message1.txt -output encrypted1.txt -encrypt
# 4: bob will decrypt the message
./rsa.sh -key bob -input encrypted1.txt -output message1b.txt -decrypt
# 5: are they the same?
diff message1.txt message1b.txt
# 6: bob now sends a message to alice
./rsa.sh -key alice -input message2.txt -output encrypted2.txt -encrypt
# 7: alice will decrypt the message
./rsa.sh -key alice -input encrypted2.txt -output message2b.txt -decrypt
# 8: are they the same?
diff message2.txt message2b.txt
# 9: alice signs her message1.txt
./rsa.sh -key alice -input message1.txt -sign
# 10: bob checks that sign; they should match
./rsa.sh -key alice -input message1.txt -checksign
# 11: modify message1.txt

diff charlie-cracked-private.key charlie-private.key
# 16: clean up files (commented out by default)
#/bin/rm -f alice*.key bob*.key charlie*.key message*.sign message?b.txt encrypted?.txt message?.txt</code></pre>
<p>This file creates two files (message1.txt and message2.txt), and will overwrite those files if they already exist; those two files are deleted by the last line in the script. You are welcome (and encouraged) to use other, longer, message test files – might we suggest some <a href='http://www.historyplace.com/speeches/previous.htm'>great speeches</a>? However, make <strong><em>SURE</em></strong> that the text is all ASCII, since your program will likely not be able to handle UTF-8 characters – and when you cut-and-paste, characters like the dash and quotes often do not cut-and-paste into their ASCII equivalents. Run <code>file message1.txt</code> to check if it is ASCII or not (not ASCII is typically reported as ‘UTF-8’).</p>
<p>Assuming you don’t have any extraneous output (which you shouldn’t), the only command that should output anything is step 12. Again, you can see the test script at <a href='rsa/test-rsa.sh'>test-rsa.sh</a> (<a href='rsa/test-rsa.sh.html'>HTML version</a>).</p>
<p>Note that the last line deletes the intermediate files; during development, you may want to comment that line out to see those files.</p>
<p>The output should be just:</p>
<pre><code>Signatures do not match!</code></pre>
<p>While we are not going to try to break your program with strange combinations of command line parameters (trying to decrypt but not specifying a key), we would encourage you to put some sanity error‐checking code in your methods for your own sanity while developing the program.</p>
<h4 id='windows'>Windows</h4>
<p>If you are using Microsoft Windows, and are <em>NOT</em> using the Linux subsystem, then you may want to try the <a href='rsa/test-rsa.bat'>test-rsa.bat</a> (<a href='rsa/test-rsa.bat.html'>HTML version</a>) file. <strong><em>WARNING:</em></strong> this is a beta release of this batch file, and it’s not yet clear that it works. To use it, create a <code>rsa.bat</code> (not <code>rsa.sh</code>) file that calls your code, as above. Note that you still have to submit a <code>rsa.sh</code> file when you submit the assignment.</p>
</div><div id='tnotes' class='tabcontent'><h3 id='notes'>Notes</h3>
<p><strong>Determining SHA-256 hashes:</strong> We are using the SHA-256 hash for this assignment. If you want to see if a string has the same SHA-256 as a file, make sure they are EXACTLY the same. If the file has a ending newline (<code>\n</code>) character, and the string does not, then the SHA-256 sums will not match! You can find the SHA-256 hash of a file via the <code>sha256sum</code> command (<code>CertUtil -hashfile message1.txt SHA256</code> on Windows):</p>
<pre><code>$ sha256sum message1.txt 
bdf712419bb34b8c0f0d08126f191ecab5da9c0dbb4d2711d3c8eed6f5d42f2a  message1.txt</code></pre>
<p>If your system does not have sha256sum, you can switch over to MD5 <strong>but only for development</strong>! To do that, change the value of the <code>hashAlgorithm</code> variable to “MD5”. You can then use the <code>md5</code> or <code>md5sum</code> commands similarly to what is shown above for <code>sha256sum</code>. Be sure to change it back to “SHA-256” before submission!</p>
<p>Note that, given an input file, your SHA-256 hash computation should print out the <em>exact</em> same result as the <code>sha256sum</code> command on your favorite Unix system. But see the warning, above, about making sure the contents are the exact same.</p>
<p><strong>Creating the block:</strong> You will have a series of characters to put into a block (or, for decryption, to extract out of the block). There are a few ways you can do this. You can convert it to a byte array (the <code>String getBytes()</code> method does this) – each value in that array is a single (ASCII-encoded) value. You can optionally multiply the current running block by 256, then add the current value to be appended to the block. Obviously, your number will need to be in a <code>BigInteger</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Block size determination:</strong> To figure out your block size (which we’ll call <em>b</em>) – which is the number of characters you can encode in one block – let <em>x</em> be the number of bits in <em>n</em> (found via the BigInteger <code>bitLength()</code> method). Divide <em>x-1</em> by 8 (the minus one is important here to prevent rounding issues). As mentioned below, you can assume that we will always use keys that support a block size of at least 2. This is for <em>encryption</em> only. For decryption, the block size will be indicated in the ciphertext file which, when read in by the provided <code>readCipherTextFromFile()</code> method, will be in the <code>blockLength</code> field of the returned <code>CipherText</code> object.</p>
<p><strong>Block size minimum:</strong> Each block will be a whole number of 8-bit characters, so we will not be splitting characters between blocks. Thus, if your keys can hold up to 31 bits per block (if 2^<sup>31</sup>^ &lt; <em>n</em> &lt; 2^<sup>32</sup>^), we will only encode 24 bits (3 characters) in that block, not 31 bits. That being said, you can assume that all blocks we will use will allow for at least 2 characters per block. Note that the number passed in via <code>-keygen</code> is the bit size for <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>; <em>n</em> is roughly twice that size.</p>
<p><strong>ASCII:</strong> All files (messages, keys, ciphertext, what‐not) will have only printable ASCII characters, so you need not worry about binary files. But there may be whitespace as well: newlines, tabs, linefeeds, etc. Make sure that your code does not have UTF-8 characters in it! Given a file, you can tell what type of characters it has via the <code>file foo.txt</code> command in Linux and Mac OS X. Under Windows, you can right-click on the file in Explorer, and it should tell you the file type. In particular, if you use IntelliJ (or similar), make sure it writes the files as ASCII (or UTF-8) files, <em>not</em> Unicode files.</p>
</div><div id='thints' class='tabcontent'><h3 id='hints'>Hints</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you understand what the provided source code does. A lot of the trickier parts of the assignment, especially dealing with I/O, are handled for you.</li>
<li>The crack method is supposed to be an inefficient for loop that tries all numbers until it can factor <span class='math inline'><em>n</em></span>. (You only need to check the odd numbers, but it’s fine if you do it either way).</li>
<li>Splitting text into a block: make sure your encrypt function works. Once you know the block size (in characters), can use the <code>split()</code> method to create successive blocks.</li>
<li>Python: once you get the hash (via the functions from the <code>hashlib</code> module), you can call both <code>digest()</code> and <code>hexdigest()</code> (see the hashlib documentation for details). The former will provide a binary hash, which is less useful to us. The latter will provide an ASCII hash, which is much easier for us to use.</li>
