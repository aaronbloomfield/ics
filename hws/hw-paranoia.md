ICS: Written Homework: Rational Paranoia
==========================================

[Go up to the ICS HW page](index.html) ([md](index.md))

You will want to see the [homeworks policies page](../uva/hw-policies.html)
([md](../uva/hw-policies.md)) for formatting and other details.  The due
dates are listed on the [UVa course page](../uva/index.html)
([md](../uva/index.md)).

### Assignment

For each of the three total scenarios (two from our list, one of your own, as explained below), imagine that you are in charge of security. Apply the security mindset, discussed in the [security mindset slide set](../slides/security-mindset.html#/), to answer these questions:

- *What assets are important for you to protect?*
- *What security threats will you choose to defend against?*
- *What countermeasures can you justify, in terms of costs and benefits?*
	
Answer each of the above in the form of a bulleted list, with brief justifications or explanations as necessary. State any critical assumptions you decide to make. Your grade will be based on the thoroughness, realism, and thoughtfulness of your analysis.  We are more interested in quality than quantity.  But if you want a length estimate, then one or two sentences for each "brief_explanation", below, is reasonable.  That being said, as long as you are being concise and not adding in fluff (see [here](../uva/hw-policies.html) ([md](../uva/hw-policies.md)) for a definition of fluff), they can be longer.

Pick two of the following scenarios. 

- After the recent [downtime of the NOTAM system by the FAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_FAA_system_outage), which turned out to be caused by a contractor mistakenly deleting files, you are tasked with preventing this system's downtime in the future.
- The [US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission) is in charge of enforcing law against market manipulation.  While the SEC does not (yet) have jurisdiction over cryptocurrencies, they still want to ensure some sort of legality with cryptocurrency scams, especially after the recent and very public [FTX cryptocurrency exchange collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_of_FTX).  You can do this on either hacks (computerized attacks against cryptocurrency systems) or scams ([rug pulls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_scam), bad investments, etc.), but not both; and you can't do the other one for your second case, either.
- A professor at State University wants to perform classified research for the US government.  In addition to having to handle international students performing the research, one has to ensure the security of the information as well.  Describe how you would ensure such confidentiality.


<!-- from summer 2022:
- You are a company who handles military contracts with the US government, and as a result of the recent invasion of Ukraine by Russia, you are a target for Russian hackers.  How do you secure your system?
- Your organization is going to invest in cryptocurrency.  Although you may not know much about it, you know more than the head of the company, so they turn to you for how to keep it secure.
- UVA data breach!  The 2FA (two factor authentication) that UVA uses is exploitable.  A fix is in the works, but that will take two weeks to implement.  In the mean time, how do you secure UVA's logins?
- For the upcoming election in the fall, you are the person in charge of security for your candidate.  This involves logins, social media, and email accounts.
-->

<!-- from summer 2021:
- You were hired by the Pilgrim Pipeline Company to ensure their cybersecurity, including against ransomware attacks.  However, the company does not have a culture of secure computer habits.  How do you ensure the security of the company?
- You manage a store, and mask rules have been relaxed by the CDC.  Those relaxed rules state that a fully vaccinated adult does not need to wear a mask.  However, it's hard to tell who is fully vaccinated, and who is not vaccinated but resistant to wearing a mask.  How do you protect your customers?
- You are in charge of the security for a home football game here at UVa -- assume that this is after the pandemic is fully over, and strangers can sit next to each other again.
- State U just won a basketball championship!  Unlike UVa's win in 2019, there is expected to be violence and rioting by the student body.  How do you ensure safety on campus?
-->

<!-- from summer 2020:
- You are supporting an application for which the group that will be using it is not computer savvy at all.  How do you ensure the application's security when they all have full access to edit and delete items in the system?
- You manage a store during the covid-19 pandemic, and have to ensure the health and security of your employees.
- People are illegally disposing of chemicals into a recreational lake, and it's killing the fish and tainting the water supply.
- You are in charge of ensuring that pilots on airplanes are kept safe and healthy during the covid-19 pandemic.  Recall that airplanes circulate their air supply throughout the entire airplane throughout the flight, and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes covid-19) is, apparently, airborne.
-->

<!-- from fall 2019:
- You are in charge of protecting the water supply to a town or city, which is sourced from a reservoir that is publicly usable.
- A huge political rally will be held on Grounds, and you are in charge of ensuring it's security (no politicians will be present, though).
- You are asked to design the security for the goods crossing the English Channel after the currently stated Brexit deadline of October 31st.
- You are tasked with creating a policy to ensure the secure voting in the 2020 presidential election.
- You are asked to design a means to prevent private drones (the types that you can buy on Amazon for very little) from flying near airplanes -- a concern is if they were used to attack an airplane by being injested into an engine.
-->

<!-- from spring 2019:
- You are in charge of the security of the nationâ€™s power plants.
- You are in charge of designing the new TSA airport checking process.
- You are in charge of the security of a world renowned tech conference.
- You are developing an Internet enabled automobile, and want to keep it secure from malware.
- You are the in charge of security for your local high school.
-->

<!-- from fall 2018:
- You have to plan for the next anniversary of the [Unite the Right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Right_rally) rally, again in Charlottesville
- You are hired by [WillowTree](https://willowtreeapps.com/) to help secure their servers from corporate espionage
- You are grading homework 1 submissions for a class of 80 students
- You are in charge of the security for a home football game here at UVa
- You are in charge of making an election voting system that is both secure and has auditing capabilities
--> 

In addition, come up with another scenario from everyday life that we have not discussed in class.  Your choice can be directly related to computer security, but it does not have to be.

### Submission Template

Obviously reformat this in your word processor of choice.  The file to be submitted **MUST BE A PDF DOCUMENT**.  Please name it `paranoia.pdf`.  The page must be exactly three pages long, and each case must be on a separate page.  The case that you come up with must be on page three.  This is all to facilitate grading -- the document is going to be split by pages, and each page will be graded separately.
