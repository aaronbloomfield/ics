Homework: US Cybersecurity Policy</h1>
<p><a href="index.html">Go up to the ICS HW page</a> (<a
href="index.md">md</a>)</p>
<p>You will want to see the <a href="../uva/hw-policies.html">homeworks
policies page</a> (<a href="../uva/hw-policies.md">md</a>) for
formatting and other details. The due dates are listed on the <a
href="../uva/index.html">UVa course page</a> (<a
href="../uva/index.md">md</a>).</p>
<h3 id="assignment">Assignment</h3>
<p>You will need to be familiar with the content of the <a
href="../slides/policy.html#/">US Cybersecurity Policy slide
set</a>.</p>
<p>For this assignment, you are to write an essay on the following
topic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What would you suggest to do to improve US cybersecurity policy?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You may make any assumptions that are viable. Examples include
actions that are taken by the president, a member of congress, etc. You
may not make unreasonable assumptions (“the parties in congress will
work together without lobbyist influence and pass a bill that works!”).
However, please state any assumptions that you are making.</p>
<p>Your actions don’t need to <em>fix</em> it in one fell swoop – it may
well be that your actions make a marked improvement, but do not
completely fix it. You will need to cite some evidence that your
proposal will make some positive change. This can be references (online
or other, but they need to be accessible to us for the grading) or
explanation of how/why your proposal will have an effect.</p>
<p>The essay must be 500 words <strong><em>or less</em></strong>. That’s
about 1 page worth of content. We are more interested in quality rather
than quantity, so we aren’t going to grade it based on length. Note that
any header information (name, title, date, class, etc.) do not count
toward the word limit. References, if you use any, also do not count
against this limit. <strong><em>If it is over 500 words, then we will
not grade it and give you a zero!</em></strong> The <a
href="../uva/hw-policies.html">HW policies page</a> (<a
href="../uva/hw-policies.md">md</a>) discusses this in a bit more
detail.</p>
<p>In addition to the viable assumptions from above, we are looking for
a well thought out policy changes that are <em>reasonable</em>. So
stating that Congress should pass a law to force everybody to use high
levels of encryption (for example) is not reasonable in the current
political climate. Nor are presidential executive orders that exceed the
authority vested in said orders. We can tell if you are just giving us a
load of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit">BS</a>, and we
will give you a zero if you do that.</p>
<p>Did you read the section about fluff in the <a
href="../uva/hw-policies.html">homeworks policies page</a> (<a
href="../uva/hw-policies.md">md</a>)? When one is grading dozens of
these assignments, one becomes a great fluff detector, and will mark
your assignment down – or give you a zero – for it. It’s a waste of your
time and also a waste of our time.</p>
<h3 id="submission">Submission</h3>
<p>Please ensure that you follow <em>all</em> four of these
requirements:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You will submit <em>both</em> a PDF <strong><em>and a .docx
file</em></strong> of your essay. If you are not using Microsoft Word,
then just export your final copy to a Word file (.docx format) – all
modern word processors can do this.</li>
<li>Please put your word count at the top of your essay. As mentioned
above, any header info (name, class, date, title, etc.), as well as
references, do not count toward this word count. And the required text
“499 words” doesn’t count, either, of course (replace 499 with your
actual word count).</li>
<li>Is your essay it 500 words or less? If not, you are going to get a
zero!</li>
<li>You <strong><em>MUST</em></strong> name your files userid.pdf and
userid.docx where ‘userid’ is your UVa userid.</li>
</ol>
