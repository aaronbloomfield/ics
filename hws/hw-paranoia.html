Rational Paranoia</h1>
<p><a href="index.html">Go up to the ICS HW page</a> (<a
href="index.md">md</a>)</p>
<p>You will want to see the <a href="../uva/hw-policies.html">homeworks
policies page</a> (<a href="../uva/hw-policies.md">md</a>) for
formatting and other details. The due dates are listed on the <a
href="../uva/index.html">UVa course page</a> (<a
href="../uva/index.md">md</a>).</p>
<h3 id="assignment">Assignment</h3>
<p>For each of the three total scenarios (two from our list, one of your
own, as explained below), imagine that you are in charge of security.
Apply the security mindset (discussed in the <a
href="../slides/security-mindset.html#/">security slide set</a>) to
answer these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What assets are important for you to protect?</em></li>
<li><em>What security threats will you choose to defend
against?</em></li>
<li><em>What countermeasures can you justify, in terms of costs and
benefits?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Answer each of the above in the form of a bulleted list, with brief
justifications or explanations as necessary. State any critical
assumptions you decide to make. Your grade will be based on the
thoroughness, realism, and thoughtfulness of your analysis. We are more
interested in quality than quantity. But if you want a length estimate,
then one or two sentences for each “brief_explanation”, below, is
reasonable. That being said, as long as you are being concise and not
adding in fluff (see <a href="../uva/hw-policies.html">here</a> (<a
href="../uva/hw-policies.md">md</a>) for a definition of fluff), they
can be longer.</p>
<p>Pick two of the following scenarios. (If you answer more, we’ll only
grade the first two)</p>
<ul>
<li>You were hired by the Pilgrim Pipeline Company to ensure their
cybersecurity, including against ransomware attacks. However, the
company does not have a culture of secure computer habits. How do you
ensure the security of the company?</li>
<li>You manage a store, and mask rules have been relaxed by the CDC.
Those relaxed rules state that a fully vaccinated adult does not need to
wear a mask. However, it’s hard to tell who is fully vaccinated, and who
is not vaccinated but resistant to wearing a mask. How do you protect
your customers?</li>
<li>You are in charge of the security for a home football game here at
UVa – assume that this is after the pandemic is fully over, and
strangers can sit next to each other again.</li>
<li>State U just won a basketball championship! Unlike UVa’s win in
2019, there is expected to be violence and rioting by the student body.
How do you ensure safety on campus?</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, choose another scenario from everyday life that we
haven’t discussed in class. Your choice can be directly related to
computer security, but it does not have to be.</p>
