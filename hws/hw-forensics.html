<h1 id="ics-programming-homework-forensics">ICS: Programming Homework: Forensics</h1>
<p><a href="index.html">Go up to the ICS HW page</a> (<a href="index.md">md</a>)</p>
<p>You will want to see the <a href="../uva/hw-policies.html">homeworks policies page</a> (<a href="../uva/hw-policies.md">md</a>) for formatting and other details. The due dates are listed on the <a href="../uva/index.html">UVa course page</a> (<a href="../uva/index.md">md</a>).</p>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Emma Turner led a very secluded life. You knew little about her, or what she did. She rented an apartment down the hall from you, and you saw her occasionally -- but probably spoke a total of 5 words to her in the two years that you lived across from each other.</p>
<p>About a month ago, though, she disappeared. You could tell that something was up as the lights in her apartment no longer went on at night. The police were called, but the could find no indication of foul play, so they closed the criminal part of the case and listed her as a missing person.</p>
<p>Her brother, Joss, showed up a few weeks later. You've known Joss for a while, and have done some (paid) off-the-books work for him in the past. Joss is worried that something was &quot;up&quot; with Emma's disappearance, although he had no idea what it was. And he has no idea where she is. He searched the apartment, but to no avail. The only thing that Joss was not able to properly search was Emma's computer. He stated that he has no idea what could have happened to her.</p>
<p>Joss has asked you to look into Emma's computer to see what you can find out. You took an image of the hard drive, which uses Linux, and you have that to work from.</p>
<p>Joss would like you to help him find out (1) where Emma went, and (2) who he can contact about Emma's sudden disappearance.</p>
<p>But you have no idea what to look for...</p>
<p>(Note: in the real world, you might get into legal trouble for doing this type of search, since the owner of the computer did not give you permission. But this is an assignment, and FAKE, so there is no legal trouble to get into for this assignment.)</p>
<h3 id="assignment">Assignment</h3>
<p>Find out what's &quot;up&quot;.</p>
<p>Spoiler: there is obviously a story that this disk image can tell, otherwise there wouldn't be this assignment.</p>
<p>The intent is for you to use Autopsy / SleuthKit for this assignment, as well as some command-line tools. You will also want to be familiar with the <a href="../slides/forensics.html#/">digital forensics slide set</a>.</p>
<h3 id="details">Details</h3>
<p>You can get a copy of the hard drive image by going to <a href="https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/forensics/" class="uri">https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/forensics/</a> -- you will have to use Netbadge to log in. <strong>You can not use somebody else's disk image!</strong> If it says that your image is not yet ready, try again in an hour or so. The image was compressed with gzip -- if your operating system does not natively support it, then you can use <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/">7-zip</a> to extract it. The compressed .gz file is 4 Gb in size, and the uncompressed image is 10 Gb in size.</p>
<p>This image was designed using Linux (it's an ext4 file system). However, you can do this homework on any host OS. The VirtualBox image is configured to run Autopsy.</p>
<h3 id="tools-allowed">Tools allowed</h3>
<p>The intent of this assignment is for you to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy_(software%29)">Autopsy</a> / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sleuth_Kit">SleuthKit</a>. In addition to Autopsy and SleuthKit, you can use the standard tools that come with an operating system -- in particular, file explorers, searching contents of files for text, etc. You can use any of the utilities discussed in the <a href="../slides/forensics.html#/">digital forensics slide set</a>. You can use differently named equivalents in differing operating systems.</p>
<p><strong>You may NOT use any OTHER existing digital forensic tools for this assignment,</strong> beyond the what is mentioned in the previous paragraph. You are to use your knowledge of forensics, the <a href="../slides/forensics.html#/">forensics slide set</a>, and the existing OS commands. In particular, the &quot;Techniques&quot; section of that slide set has the necessary techniques to find what can be found on this disk image. We recommend learning a few commands: <code>strings</code> and <code>grep</code> are going to be particularly useful for Linux. You can Google for equivalents in other OSes. Note that some of the information on the disk image was specifically designed to NOT be able to be (easily) found with Autopsy / SleuthKit.</p>
<p>You can install Autopsy by viewing the <a href="https://www.sleuthkit.org/autopsy/download.php">details at Autopsy's website</a>. The current version is 4.10 -- make sure you are using that version (or a more recent one if available).</p>
<h3 id="running-on-the-virtualbox-image">Running on the VirtualBox image</h3>
<p>To run Autopsy on the VirtualBox image, you must use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>/usr/local/autopsy-4.11.0/bin/autopsy --jdkhome /usr/local/jre1.8.0_221/</code></pre>
<p>This should be aliased to <code>autopsy</code>...</p>
<h3 id="deliverable">Deliverable</h3>
<p>The deliverable is a PDF report, named mst3k.pdf (change 'mst3k' to your userid).</p>
<p>The report will be divided into a number of parts. So that we can easily figure out what you found out, please make it clear which part of your report are for which part.</p>
<p>Part 1 is the two questions of Joss' to answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where is our missing person?</li>
<li>What parts of the story can you put together?</li>
</ul>
<p>This part of this report should contain as much of the story as you can determine. Note that you will be able to get partial credit based on what you find, even if you don't find everything.</p>
<p>The second part of this report should contain the information that you found, and how you found it. The how-you-found-it is is important, as there are a multiple ways to find each piece of information. Please be brief, but concise -- we have to read through all of these, and we don't want to read through pages and pages of content when it can be summarized in a much shorter amount.</p>
<p>The third part is to comment on this assignment:</p>
<ul>
<li>What did you think of it? We are looking for an honest answer here, not a sycophantic one.</li>
<li>Was there anything that we screwed up on? Specifically, was there a particular piece of evidence in which we did not properly hide something? Or did we give something away?</li>
<li>Give one (or more!) suggestions for additional content to hide, or where to hide it, or improvements to the story.</li>
</ul>
<p>The PDF report is the only item to submit.</p>
