<h3 id="lateness">Lateness</h3>
<p>Any late assignment is docked 25% per day late, rounded up. So an assignment that is 1 second late to 24 hours late will its score reduced by 25% (i.e., multiplied by 0.75); 24 hours and 1 second to 48 hours has the score reduced by 50%, and so on. This means that after 3 days (72 hours) late, it will receive a zero. The submission server’s clock is set to the <a href="https://time.gov">US Navy Atomic clock</a>.</p>
<h3 id="fluff">Fluff</h3>
<p>We don’t like fluff! This mostly applies to the written homeworks, but could certainly apply to the programming homeworks as well in the comments. Fluff is when you add lots of extra verbiage to pad out a written assignment to make it look longer, or to try to get certain keywords in because you think it will help with the grading. Trust us, it won’t – we don’t scan for keywords. We read the entire assignment. If it’s too long, or it’s full of fluff, then we will get cranky and give you a zero. We are looking for quality over quantity. Thus, there is no particular required length. And don’t do any of that silly formatting with fonts or margins to make it look longer, either. We were all college students once, and we know all those tricks too…</p>
<h3 id="grammar-and-spelling">Grammar and spelling</h3>
<p>While this is not an English course, you have to have well English in your document – both spelling and grammar. If you can’t figure out what that sqiggly red line under a mis-spelled word means, then we are going to get all cranky when grading it.</p>
<h3 id="submission-format">Submission format</h3>
<p>All written homeworks must be submitted as a PDF. This is an upper level elective for comptuer science majors, so if you don’t submit it as a PDF, we won’t grade it. The PDF has to be a reasonable file size for the submission system to accept it – since there aren’t likely to be images in the document, that shouldn’t be a problem.</p>
