<p><a href="index.html">Go up to the ICS HW page</a> (<a href="index.md">md</a>)</p>
<p>Jason Belford, the CISO (Chief Information Security Officer) for UVa, will be visiting the class on Wednesday, April 17th, to give a brief overview of what he does as CISO, and to answer questions.</p>
<p>This homework is to generate two <em>good</em> questions that you could (potentially) ask him. With the number of students in the class, obviously not everybody will be able to ask questions.</p>
<p>Write your questions in a TEXT FILE, and name it <code>mst3k.txt</code> (replace mst3k with your userid).</p>
<p><strong>IF YOU DO NOT NAME IT CORRECTLY, YOU WILL GET A ZERO!!!</strong></p>
<p>This must be submitted by the end of the day before the visit. Late submissions will not be accepted on this assignment!</p>
