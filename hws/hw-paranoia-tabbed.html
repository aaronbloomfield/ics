<div id='toverview' class='tabcontent'><h3 id='overview'>Overview</h3>
<p>This assignment will focus on analyzing security in three different scenarios; two of which you choose from the list below, and one of which you create yourself. The deliverable is a typed PDF document. You will need to be familiar with the <a href='../slides/security-mindset.html#/'>Security Mindset slide set</a>.</p>
<p>You will want to see the <a href='../uva/hw-policies.html'>homeworks policies page</a> (<a href='../uva/hw-policies.md'>md</a>) for formatting and other details. The due dates are listed on the Canvas landing page.</p>
</div><div id='tchangelog' class='tabcontent'><h3 id='changelog'>Changelog</h3>
<p>Any changes to this page will be put here for easy reference. Typo fixes and minor clarifications are not listed here. So far there aren’t any significant changes to report.</p>
</div><div id='tassignment' class='tabcontent'><h3 id='assignment'>Assignment</h3>
<p>For each of the three total scenarios (two from our list, one of your own, as explained below), imagine that you are in charge of security. Apply the security mindset, discussed in the <a href='../slides/security-mindset.html#/'>security mindset slide set</a>, to answer these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What assets are important for you to protect?</em></li>
<li><em>What security threats will you choose to defend against?</em></li>
<li><em>What countermeasures can you justify, in terms of costs and benefits?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Answer each of the above in the form of a bulleted list, with brief justifications or explanations as necessary. State any critical assumptions you decide to make. Your grade will be based on the thoroughness, realism, and thoughtfulness of your analysis. We are more interested in quality than quantity. But if you want a length estimate, then one or two sentences for each “brief_explanation”, below, is reasonable. That being said, as long as you are being concise and not adding in fluff (see <a href='../uva/hw-policies.html'>here</a> (<a href='../uva/hw-policies.md'>md</a>) for a definition of fluff), they can be longer.</p>
<p>Pick two of the following scenarios.</p>
<ul>
<li>You are in charge of security for a political individual (politician, judge, candidate) who has received threats in this politically divisive era</li>
<li>You are the head of computing security for a corporation that is being targeted by foreign actors who want to steal your technological intellectual property</li>
<li>Threats have been made against interior hydrological structures, specifically dams, and you are now responsible for their security</li>
<li>You are the computing security individual in charge at a company who handles military contracts with the US government, and as a result of the recent invasion of Ukraine by Russia, you are a target for Russian hackers</li>
</ul>











<p>In addition, come up with another scenario from everyday life that we have not discussed in class. Your choice can be directly related to computer security, but it does not have to be.</p>
</div><div id='tsubmission-template' class='tabcontent'><h3 id='submission-template'>Submission Template</h3>
<p>Obviously reformat this in your word processor of choice. The file to be submitted <strong>MUST BE A PDF DOCUMENT</strong>. Please name it <code>paranoia.pdf</code>. The page must be exactly three pages long, and <strong>each case must be on a separate page</strong>. The case that you come up with must be on page three. This is all to facilitate grading – the document is going to be split by pages, and each page will be graded separately.</p>
