<div id='toverview' class='tabcontent'><h3 id='overview'>Overview</h3>
<p>This assignment will focus on analyzing security in three different scenarios; two of which you choose from the list below, and one of which you create yourself. The deliverable is a typed PDF document. You will need to be familiar with the <a href='../slides/security-mindset.html#/'>Security Mindset slide set</a>.</p>
<p>You will want to see the <a href='../uva/hw-policies.html'>homeworks policies page</a> (<a href='../uva/hw-policies.md'>md</a>) for formatting and other details. The due dates are listed on the Canvas landing page.</p>
</div><div id='tchangelog' class='tabcontent'><h3 id='changelog'>Changelog</h3>
<p>Any changes to this page will be put here for easy reference. Typo fixes and minor clarifications are not listed here. So far there aren’t any significant changes to report.</p>
</div><div id='tassignment' class='tabcontent'><h3 id='assignment'>Assignment</h3>
<p>For each of the three total scenarios (two from our list, one of your own, as explained below), imagine that you are in charge of security. Apply the security mindset, discussed in the <a href='../slides/security-mindset.html#/'>security mindset slide set</a>, to answer these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What assets are important for you to protect?</em></li>
<li><em>What security threats will you choose to defend against?</em></li>
<li><em>What countermeasures can you justify, in terms of costs and benefits?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Answer each of the above in the form of a bulleted list, with brief justifications or explanations as necessary. State any critical assumptions you decide to make. Your grade will be based on the thoroughness, realism, and thoughtfulness of your analysis. We are more interested in quality than quantity. But if you want a length estimate, then one or two sentences for each “brief_explanation”, below, is reasonable. That being said, as long as you are being concise and not adding in fluff (see <a href='../uva/hw-policies.html'>here</a> (<a href='../uva/hw-policies.md'>md</a>) for a definition of fluff), they can be longer.</p>
<p>Pick two of the following scenarios.</p>
<ul>
<li>You are trying to secure your home network. You have dozens of IoT devices, and individuals who install a lot of sketchy apps on their mobile phones. How do you secure this home network?</li>
<li>You are now in charge of ensuring that UVA protesters can express their first amendment rights through protest, while also ensuring the safety of bot the protesters and the UVA community. How do you do this?
<ul>
<li>NOTE: This is a <em>security</em> analysis, not a chance for political opining. Regardless of what side you are on, focus on the security aspects. There are many great ways to express your political opinions, but doing so in the answer to this question on this homework is not one of them. As long as you focus on the security aspects, any political views that come out will have zero effect on your grade for this question.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There is a <a href='https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2024/4/committee-chairs-cantwell-mcmorris-rodgers-unveil-historic-draft-comprehensive-data-privacy-legislation'>privacy rights bill</a> that is currently under consideration (as of May 2024) in Congress. How do you ensure the privacy of Americans through this act, while not harming Internet security and ensuring that online businesses can properly function?
<ul>
<li>Again, this is meant to be a security analysis, not your personal views about data mongering (which we’ll talk about later this semester)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Anna_Nuclear_Generating_Station'>North Anna Nuclear Generating Station</a> supplies about half of the electricity for Charlottesville; the other half is from a local coal plant. The cooling lake for that nuclear plant, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Anna'>Lake Anna</a>, is a popular location for recreational boating. How would you secure the plant? This should take into account both the fact that it is on a well-used lake, as well as any terrorism concerns; this should not focus on the securing of their computer network, nor the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Anna_Nuclear_Generating_Station#2011_Virginia_earthquake'>earthquake whose epicenter was only 11 miles away</a>.</li>
</ul>









<p>In addition, come up with another scenario from everyday life that we have not discussed in class. Your choice can be directly related to computer security, but it does not have to be.</p>
</div><div id='tsubmission-template' class='tabcontent'><h3 id='submission-template'>Submission Template</h3>
<p>Obviously reformat this in your word processor of choice. The file to be submitted <strong>MUST BE A PDF DOCUMENT</strong>. Please name it <code>paranoia.pdf</code>. The page must be exactly three pages long, and <strong>each case must be on a separate page</strong>. The case that you come up with must be on page three. This is all to facilitate grading – the document is going to be split by pages, and each page will be graded separately.</p>
