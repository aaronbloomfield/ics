<p><a href="index.html">Go up to the ICS HW page</a> (<a href="index.md">md</a>)</p>
<p>You must design your own cryptocurrency! Your implementation must be secure enough that you could actually use it.</p>
<p>You may use any programming language for this, but if you want to use a language other than C, C++, Java, or Python, please check with us first.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Your cryptocurrency should have a name – ideally, think of a neat name, but make sure it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptocurrencies">not already taken</a>. It will have to use public/private key encryption to generate the wallets. You do not have to use symmetric encryption (such as AES) to protect the private key in the wallet. You will need to use a good hashing algorithm. In practice, SHA-256 would be the minimum, but you can use a shorter SHA hash for this assignment.</p>
<p>The intent is not for you to write the hashing or encryption / decryption routines – use existing libraries for that. In particular, both Java and Python can do that for you. Be careful about requiring an uncommon Python module, Java library, or C/C++ library, as it still has to run on the submission server.</p>
<p>One option will be to copy how Bitcoin handles these functions, as described in the <a href="../slides/cryptocurrency.html#/">Cryptocurrency slide set</a> slide set.</p>
<h2 id="languages">Languages</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, you may use any programming language for this, but if you want to use a language other than C, C++, Java, or Python, please check with us first. We support Go (version 1.10), but we do not have any additional information available for it in terms of links or supplied functions.</p>
<p>For Java and Python, we provide you with the code to convert a hex string to an array of bytes, to convert an array of bytes to a hex string, getting the SHA-256 hash of a file, and to read and write RSA keys. For Java, that is in the form of methods that you can use. For Python, it is links to the library functions that performs that task.</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong> you have to use Python 3 for this. We will install the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/rsa/">rsa</a> package; the documentation for that library, including code examples, is <a href="https://stuvel.eu/rsa">here</a>. Some of these functions will require you to encode your message as ASCII (it gives ‘Unicode-objects must be encoded before hashing’ message otherwise) – just call <code>.encode('ascii')</code> on the string first. Encoding from a byte array to a string is done via the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/binascii.html">binascii</a> library. Hashes in Python are in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html">hashlib</a>, which is part of the Python installation. To take the SHA-256 hash of a file, see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/44873382">this code on stack overflow</a>. You can see some example code in the <a href="cryptocurrency/sample.py">sample.py</a> (<a href="cryptocurrency/sample.py.html">html</a>) file for you to use.</p>
<p><strong>Java:</strong> RSA and SHA are already in the standard Java library; you can look <a href="https://www.devglan.com/java8/rsa-encryption-decryption-java">here</a> for how to handle RSA in Java, and see the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/security/MessageDigest.html">MessageDigest class</a> for SHA (and the example <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/sha-256-hashing-java">here</a>). An example about how to sign a message can be found <a href="https://niels.nu/blog/2016/java-rsa.html">here</a>. You may use any of the code on those pages for your program. Note that the Java version on the submission server is 1.8. We provide some methods in the <a href="cryptocurrency/Sample.java">Sample.java</a> (<a href="cryptocurrency/Sample.java.html">html</a>) file for you to use.</p>
<p><strong>C/C++:</strong> Boost is installed, as well as the openssl library. There are many great things about C and C++, but we think this will give you a real headache if you try to implement it in C or C++.</p>
<h2 id="file-format">File format</h2>
<p><strong>Blockchain</strong></p>
<p>The blockchain will be in files named <code>block_0.txt</code>, <code>block_1.txt</code>, etc. The zeroth block (<code>block_0.txt</code>) will be the genesis block, and will not have any actual transactions in it. Each successive block after the genesis block will be of the following format:</p>
<ul>
<li>Line 1 will be the hash of the previous block</li>
<li>Lines 2 to <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>-1 will each hold a transaction record (which is <em>not</em> the same as a transaction statement), one per line; these will be of the form <code>S transferred x to D on w</code>, where S is the source wallet, D is the destination wallet, x is the (floating point) amount to transfer, and w is the date. The date can be any format you would like, as long as it has the date and time (with seconds). In Java, <code>new Date()</code> will achieve this; in Python 3, <code>str(datetime.now())</code> will do the same.</li>
<li>The last line will have the nonce, which is determined when the block is mined</li>
</ul>
<p>When generating the next block, you can assume that the previous block file exists. This means that we will generate the genesis block <code>block_0.txt</code> from the <code>genesis</code> command (below) before validating the first block.</p>
<p>Below is a sample block. Note that we put blank lines between the parts – that’s fine if you want to do that as well.</p>
<pre><code>81d5d3bf8c93ac07d4b4654b9e7f06dee3285444a57de4191650eacf1b105a2e

bigfoot transferred 100.0 to a3e47443b0f3bc76 on Tue Apr 02 23:09:13 EDT 2019
bigfoot transferred 100.0 to 48adadf4fb921fca on Tue Apr 02 23:09:14 EDT 2019

48adadf4fb921fca transferred 2.5 to a3e47443b0f3bc76 on Tue Apr 02 23:09:15 EDT 2019

nonce: 120</code></pre>
<p>The details about each line, as well as the ‘bigfoot’ concept, are explained below.</p>
<p><strong>Ledger</strong></p>
<p>The blocks described above represent transactions that have been completed. Pending transaction records are to be placed in the ledger, which we will appropriately call <code>ledger.txt</code>. One of the functionalities that you have to implement is the transfer of the transaction records in the ledger into a block in the block chain through mining.</p>
<p>Each line will be of the the same form as the lines in the ledger (<code>S transferred x to D on w</code>). You are welcome to use present tense as well (transfers instead of transferred). You can have additional information after the required text, but it must all be on the same line. This is important – each transaction record in the ledger must be exactly one line!</p>
<p>Below is an example of a line from the ledger. This line is a <em>transaction record</em>, which is described next.</p>
<pre><code>a3e47443b0f3bc76 transferred 12.5 to 48adadf4fb921fca on Tue Apr 02 23:09:14 EDT 2019</code></pre>
<p>Note that this is the second-to-last line in the block shown above.</p>
<p><strong>Transaction statement versus transaction record</strong></p>
<p>A transaction <em>statement</em> is a multi-line text file that contains the sender, the recipient, the amount, and ends with a digital signature. Each transaction statement will be in its own file; one is shown below.</p>
<p>A transaction <em>record</em> is a single line in a ledger (and, later, in a block in the blockchain) that contains similar information, but on a single line. The one-line example above, in the ledger section, is a transaction record.</p>
<p>Another of the functionalities that you will have to implement is the verification of a transaction statement (checking it’s signature and that there is enough money), which will then insert a single transaction record for that transaction into the ledger.</p>
<p>As an example, below is one of the transaction statements that was generated from the script provided (specifically the <code>./cryptomoney.sh transfer alice.wallet.txt $bob 12.5 03-alice-to-bob.txt</code> line). Note that you don’t have to have the same format! This is just what we used. However, it must contain the same five pieces of information: from, to, amount, date, and the signature. The one-line entry from the ledger, above, is the corresponding transaction record for this transaction statement.</p>
<pre><code>From: a3e47443b0f3bc76
To: 48adadf4fb921fca
Amount: 12.5
Date: Tue Apr 02 23:09:13 EDT 2019

5b7e1fcbde4edee8b940d820ea807558fc4b3a94108df254267c578077c03dd5d30ca62550376aabaa24f42a11f667d6b191230a50fd9de08bcd37a75dfcc3774735057d84a6aa8abe297f9ff379a02d1976006584cf4fc34ef53a92f973e58d452d0b2c48342f89ebc7cee668511c696b78c36712d2aed9ef2681977bb5a93c</code></pre>
<p>The signature is done of the first four lines of information (or however many lines contain your information). This is done when taking the signature, and the program will need to do the same when checking the signature.</p>
<p>Note that the result of a <code>fund</code> command, which comes from “bigfoot” (or whatever you call your source of funds in your cryptocurrency), then there will likely not be a signature line at the bottom of the transaction record.</p>
<p><strong>Wallet address versus wallet file</strong></p>
<p>A wallet is a public / private key set. When signing a transaction, or checking a signature, then the full wallet file will be needed. A wallet address is a shortened version of the public key. For our purposes, we should take the SHA-256 hash of the public key, and use that. However, that’s a bit long, so we can use only the first 16 bytes (characters) of that hash for brevity.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Since this can be done in any programming language, you will have to write a shell script (described below) so that we can call your code. While the shell script is described below, the particular function to be implemented is <code>shown like this</code> in the requirements below. That function will be the first command line parameter provided to the program, and any additional command line parameters are specified below. For example, to generate a wallet, you would call <code>java CMoney wallet.txt</code> or <code>python3 cmoney.py wallet.txt</code>. Note that these actual calls are in the shell script, described below.</p>
<p><strong>Output:</strong> Each command below should print out EXACTLY ONE LINE to standard output indicating the success (or failure) of the command. It will make your life much easier if this one line is from the source code.</p>
<p>The requirements are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Print the name of the cryptocurrency (<code>name</code>). This is the name from the Overview section, above. There are no additional command line parameters to this function.</li>
<li>Create the genesis block (<code>genesis</code>): this is the initial block in the block chain, and the block should always be the same. Come up with a fun quote! It should be written to a <code>block_0.txt</code> file. There are no additional command line parameters to this function.</li>
<li>Generate a wallet (<code>generate</code>): this will create RSA public/private key set (1024 bit keys is appropriate for this assignment). The resulting wallet file MUST BE TEXT – you will have to convert any binary data to text to save it (and convert it in the other direction when loading). You can see the provided helper functions, above, to help with this. The file name to save the wallet to will be provided as an additional command line parameter.</li>
<li>Get wallet tag (<code>address</code>): this will print out the tag of the public key for a given wallet, which is likely the hash of the public key. Note that it <em>only</em> prints out that tag (no other output). When the other commands talk about naming a wallet, this is what it actually means. You are welcome to use the first 16 characters of the hash of the public key for this assignment; you don’t need to use the entire hash. The file name of the wallet file will be provided as an additional command line parameter.</li>
<li>Fund wallets (<code>fund</code>): this allows us to add as much money as we want to a wallet. While this is obviously not practical in the real world, it will allow us to test your program. (Although there still needs to be a way to fund wallets in the real world also.) Create a special case ID (‘bigfoot’, ‘daddy_warbucks’, ‘lotto’, or whatever) that your program knows to use as the source for a fund request, and also knows not to verify when handling verification, below. This means that ‘bigfoot’ (or whatever) will appear alongside the hash of the public keys as the source of funds. This function will be provided with three additional command line parameters: the destination wallet address, the amount to transfer, and the file name to save the transaction statement to.</li>
<li>Transfer funds (<code>transfer</code>): this is how we pay with our cryptocurrency. It will be provided with four additional command line parameters: the source wallet file name (not the address!), the destination wallet address (not the file name!), the amount to transfer, and the file name to save the transaction statement to. Any reasonable format for the transaction statement is fine for this, as long as the transaction statement is text and thus readable by a human. Recall that it must have five pieces of information, described above in the “Transaction statement versus transaction record” section. Note that this command does <em>NOT</em> add anything to the ledger.</li>
<li>Check a balance (<code>balance</code>): based on the transactions in the block chain AND ALSO in the ledger, compute the balance for the provided wallet. This does not look at transaction <em>statements</em>, only the transaction <em>records</em> in the blocks and the ledger. The wallet address to compute the balance for is provided as an additional command line parameter.</li>
<li>Verify a transaction (<code>verify</code>): verify that a given transaction statement is valid, which will require checking the signature <strong>and</strong> the availability of funds. Once verified, it should be added to the ledger as a transaction record. This is the only way that items are added to the ledger. The wallet file name (whichever wallet created the transaction) and the transaction statement being verified are the additional command line parameters.</li>
<li>Create, mine, and sign block (<code>mine</code>): this will form another block in the blockchain. The ledger will be emptied of transaction records, as they will all go into the current block being computed. A nonce will have to be computed to ensure the hash is below a given value. Recall that the first line in any block is the SHA-256 of the last block file. The difficulty for the mining will be the additional parameter to this command. For simplicity, the difficulty will be the number of leading zeros to have in the hash value – so a value of 3 would imply that the hash must start with three leading zeros. We will be using very small difficulties here, so a brute-force method for finding the nonce is sufficient. The nonce must be a single unsigned 32 bit (or 64 bit) integer.</li>
<li>Validate the blockchain (<code>validate</code>): this should go through the entire block chain, validating each one. This means that starting with block 1 (the block <em>after</em> the genesis block), ensure that the hash listed in that file, which is the hash for the <em>previous</em> block file, is correct. There are no additional command-line parameters for this function.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="shell-script">Shell script</h2>
<p>Since different programming languages can be used, we are going to have you submit a shell script called <code>cryptomoney.sh</code> that we will use to test your code. It is basically a big case statement for each of the 10 functions listed above. A sample such shell script is available for Java: <a href="cryptocurrency/cryptomoney.sh">cryptomoney.sh</a> (<a href="cryptocurrency/cryptomoney.sh.html">html</a>) and for Python: <a href="cryptocurrency/cryptomoney2.sh">cryptomoney2.sh</a> (<a href="cryptocurrency/cryptomoney2.sh.html">html</a>). Note that you will have to edit them for your specific implementation. Also note that you will have to run <code>chmod 755 cryptomoney.sh</code> before you can run the shell script. This is set up for Java – for Python, you would replace all occurrences of “java CMoney” with “python3 cmoney.py” (or similar). Also note that the parameters provided to the shell script are listed in that shell script. It is the shell script interface that we will be using to test your code.</p>
<p>We realize that the bash syntax for case statements is pretty horrid, which is why we are providing the sample script. When calling the shell script, the function (genesis, generate, fund, etc.) will always be the first command line parameter (thus in $1). If any additional ones are needed, they will be after that (thus in $2, $3, etc.). We will never provide invalid parameters (either the wrong number, or the wrong type) to the shell script.</p>
<h2 id="sample-execution">Sample execution</h2>
<p>This is just meant to show the syntax – it is not meant to be a full fledged testing suite of your homework. However, it does call each of the commands listed above. Note that the lines with the equals signs are setting variables to be used later on. The commands used here are in the <a href="cryptocurrency/basic-test.sh">basic-test.sh</a> (<a href="cryptocurrency/basic-test.sh.html">html</a>) script. Note that you will have to run <code>chmod 755 basic-test.sh</code> before you can run the shell script. Also note that this shell script takes the SHA-256 sum of one of the block files via the <code>sha256sum</code> command – if you don’t have this command on your computer, you can remove that line.</p>
<p>In this execution run, when a wallet is generated, a signature of the public key is used to identify the wallet (or perhaps it’s the public key itself – how this is done is up to you). It is this value that is returned by the <code>address</code> call, and is indicated below in the output (<code>New wallet generated in 'alice.wallet.txt' with signature abdfa7a347c40443</code>). You can – and likely should, as this program does – use only the first 16 (or so) digits of that wallet signature rather than the full SHA-256 hash of this signature.</p>

<h2 id="miscellaneous-notes">Miscellaneous Notes</h2>
<p>There are a number of assumptions you can make for your code:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will always provide the proper parameters to the shell script – both the number, order, and validity of the parameters can be assumed.</li>
<li>The block_?.txt files will be consecutive – so there won’t be a block_3.txt missing when there is a block_4.txt.</li>
<li>The block_0.txt file will exist before any calls to verify, validate, or balance; however, the ledger.txt file may not yet exist.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="submission-requirements">Submission requirements</h2>
<p>You will submit exactly three files for this assignment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your source code file. All your code must be in a single source code file. We realize that a Java file may compile to multiple .class files, which is fine. As mentioned above, if you want to use a language other than C, C++, Java, or Python, please check with us first.</li>
<li>The shell script, which should be called <code>cryptomoney.sh</code>. We are going to call that script to test your entire code, so make sure it’s named properly!</li>
<li>A Makefile that will compile your code when we call <code>make</code>, which will be called on submission. For languages that do not need compilation (such as Python), just put in a single <code>echo</code> statement so that <code>make</code> still runs properly.</li>
</ul>
