<h1 id="ics-programming-homework-forensics">ICS: Programming Homework: Forensics</h1>
<p><a href="index.html">Go up to the ICS HW page</a> (<a href="index.md">md</a>)</p>
<p>You will want to see the <a href="../uva/hw-policies.html">homeworks policies page</a> (<a href="../uva/hw-policies.md">md</a>) for formatting and other details. The due dates are listed on the <a href="../uva/index.html">UVa course page</a> (<a href="../uva/index.md">md</a>).</p>
<h3 id="scenario">Scenario</h3>
<p>Where is Mae?</p>
<p>Mae Cartly led a very secluded life. You knew little about her, or what she did. She rented an apartment across from you, and you saw her occasionally – but probably spoke a total of 5 words to her in the two years that you lived across from each other.</p>
<p>Suddenly, though, she disappeared. You could tell that something was up as the lights in her apartment no longer went on at night. The police were called, but the could find no indication of foul play, so they closed the criminal part of the case and listed her as a missing person.</p>
<p>Her sister Laila showed up a few weeks later, and struck up a conversation with you. Laila worried that something was “up” with Mae’s disappearance, although she had no idea what it was. She searched the apartment, but to no avail. The only thing that Laila was not able to properly search was Mae’s computer.</p>
<p>Laila has asked you to look into her computer to see what you can find out. You took an image of the hard drive, which uses Linux, and you have that to work from.</p>
<p>Laila would like you to help her find out (1) where Mae went, and (2) who she can contact locally about Mae’s sudden departure.</p>
<p>But you have no idea what to look for…</p>
<h3 id="assignment">Assignment</h3>
<p>Find out what’s “up”.</p>
<p>Spoiler: there is obviously a story that this disk image can tell, otherwise there wouldn’t be this assignment.</p>
<p>The intent is for you to use Autopsy / SleuthKit for this assignment, as well as some command-line tools. You will also want to be familiar with the <a href="../slides/forensics.html#/">digital forensics slide set</a>.</p>
<h3 id="details">Details</h3>
<p>You can get a copy of the hard drive image via the links on the Canvas landing page. <strong>You can not use somebody else’s disk image!</strong> You have to wait until you are told the images are ready for this semester. The image was compressed with gzip – if your operating system does not natively support it, then you can use <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/">7-zip</a> to extract it. The compressed .gz file is about 3.5 Gb in size, and the uncompressed image is about 9 Gb in size.</p>
<p>This image was designed using Linux (it’s an ext4 file system). However, you can do this homework on any host OS. The course VirtualBox image is configured to run Autopsy. Within that image, you can download your disk image, un-gzip it, and run autopsy right from the command line.</p>
<h3 id="tools-allowed">Tools allowed</h3>
<p>The intent of this assignment is for you to use <a href="https://www.sleuthkit.org/autopsy/">Autopsy</a> / <a href="https://www.sleuthkit.org/sleuthkit/">SleuthKit</a>. In addition to Autopsy and SleuthKit, you can use the standard tools that come with an operating system – in particular, file explorers, searching contents of files for text, etc. You can use any of the utilities discussed in the <a href="../slides/forensics.html#/">digital forensics slide set</a>. You can use differently named equivalents in differing operating systems.</p>
<p>Note that, as mentioned in the slides, autopsy does not do a very good job undeleting files on an ext4 file system. You will want to use photorec for that (also installed on the VB image).</p>
<p><strong>You may NOT use any OTHER existing digital forensic tools for this assignment,</strong> beyond the what is mentioned in the previous two paragraphs. You are to use your knowledge of forensics, the <a href="../slides/forensics.html#/">forensics slide set</a>, and the existing OS commands. In particular, the “Techniques” section of that slide set has the necessary techniques to find what can be found on this disk image. We recommend learning a few commands: <code>strings</code>, <code>find</code>, and <code>grep</code> may be particularly useful for Linux. You can Google for equivalents in other OSes. Note that some of the information on the disk image was specifically designed to NOT be able to be (easily) found with Autopsy / SleuthKit.</p>
<p>If you are <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> using the course VirtualBox image, you can install Autopsy by viewing the <a href="https://www.sleuthkit.org/autopsy/download.php">details at Autopsy’s website</a>. It’s already installed on the VirtualBox image. The current version is 4.10 – make sure you are using that version (or a more recent one if available).</p>
<h3 id="running-on-the-virtualbox-image">Running on the VirtualBox image</h3>
<p>To run Autopsy on the VirtualBox image, just run <code>autopsy</code>.</p>
<p>Note that Autopsy will report a number of “Zip bombs”. We did not place any of those on the hard drive image, so you can ignore all those warnings.</p>
<h3 id="deliverable">Deliverable</h3>
<p>The deliverable is a PDF report, named mst3k.pdf (change ‘mst3k’ to your userid).</p>
<p>The report will be divided into a number of parts. So that we can easily figure out what you found out, please make it clear which part of your report are for which part.</p>
<p>Part 1 is the primary questions of answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where is our missing person? (and any other related info, such as why they are gone, who knows about it, etc.)</li>
<li>What parts of the story can you put together?</li>
</ul>
<p>This part of this report should contain as much of the story as you can determine. Note that you will be able to get partial credit based on what you find, even if you don’t find everything.</p>
<p>The second part of this report should contain the information that you found, and how you found it. The how-you-found-it is is important, as there are a multiple ways to find each piece of information. Please be brief, but concise – we have to read through all of these, and we don’t want to read through pages and pages of content when it can be summarized in a much shorter amount.</p>
<p>The third part is to comment on this assignment:</p>
<ul>
<li>What did you think of it? We are looking for an honest answer here, not a sycophantic one.</li>
<li>Was there anything that we screwed up on? Specifically, was there a particular piece of evidence in which we did not properly hide something? Or did we give something away?</li>
<li>Give one (or more!) suggestions for additional content to hide, or where to hide it, or improvements to the story.</li>
</ul>
<p>The PDF report is the only item to submit.</p>
