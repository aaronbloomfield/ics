## First, a definition...
> mal: bad, in the Latin

<p>&nbsp;</p>

> malware: software that is intended to damage or disable computers and computer systems



## Costs of Malware
- Cost of malware (worldwide):
  - 1997: $3.3 billion ([source](http://www.computereconomics.com/article.cfm?id=1225))
  - 2006: $13.3 billion ([source](http://www.computereconomics.com/article.cfm?id=1225))
  - 2014: $491 billion ([source](https://www.scmagazine.com/breaches-malware-to-cost-491-billion-in-2014-study-says/article/539302/))
  - 2015: $3 trillion ([source](https://cybersecurityventures.com/hackerpocalypse-cybercrime-report-2016/))
  - 2021: estimated to hit $6 trillion ([source](https://www.varonis.com/blog/cybersecurity-statistics/))
- Companies often cover up the worst cases
- Does not include cost of security measures



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-nb-400 norad" -->
## Malware Costs: Example 1
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/CIH.png)
- April 1999: [CIH (Chernobyl) virus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIH_virus)
  - Overwrites first megabyte of the hard drive with zeros, then overwrites the BIOS
  - Only affects Windows 95, 98, and ME
- $250 million lost in one day in Korea alone; widespread across Asia
  - Estimated $1 billion in damages in total
- Hard to quantify cost of lost files, time spent reinstalling OS and applications, etc.



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-nb-400" -->
## Malware Costs: Example 2
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Anna_Kournikova-Bagram_Airfield_2009.jpg/548px-Anna_Kournikova-Bagram_Airfield_2009.jpg)
- February 2001 mass mailer: [Anna Kournikova computer virus/worm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Kournikova_(computer_virus%29)
  - Visual Basic script via email, based on [LoveLetter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loveletter)
  - Enticed people to open it promising a picture of a popular and pretty tennis star
    - Social engineering!
  - Did little damage, though
  - The creator didn't know how to program!
	- He used a virus kit



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-nb-400" -->
## Malware Costs: Example 3
![](images/stuxnet/960px-Gas_centrifuge_cascade.jpg)
- 2010 / 2011: [Stuxnet worm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet)
  - By far the most advanced piece of malware ever created at that point
  - It's goal (and it succeeded!) was to cripple Iran's nuclear enrichment
    - Said program was set back by 1-2 years
  - Authors have not come forward, but speculation is a joint Israel / US team



## Malware Costs: Example 4
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Ashley_madison_logo.png)
- [Ashley Madison data breach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Madison_data_breach) in 2015
  - This is the site that peddled extra-marital affairs
  - The hackers threatened to release the site's DB info unless the site was closed down
    - No ransom was requested!
  - They did reveal the information, which led to embarrassment and some suicides
  - Interestingly, almost all of the "female" members were bots...



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-nb-400" -->
## Malware Costs: Example 5
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Vote_Here_sign_in_Taft%2C_Texas.jpg/891px-Vote_Here_sign_in_Taft%2C_Texas.jpg)
- [2016 US election hacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections)
  - "The US intelligence community has concluded with high confidence that the Russian government interfered in the ... election"
  - Whether it affected the outcome is up for debate
	- And not one I want to engage in now...
  - But the fact that they were able to interfere is worrisome
- Interfering in elections is a common tactic; the US has done so a lot as well ([source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/10/13/the-long-history-of-the-u-s-interfering-with-elections-elsewhere/))



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-nb-400" -->
## Malware Costs: Example 6
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/2017_Petya_cyberattack_screenshot.png)
- [NotPetya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petya_(malware%29) in 2017
  - Infected Ukrainian companies through a back door put into a Ukrainian version of a TurboTax-like software
    - Companies with Ukrainian subsidiaries were infected through their corporate network
  - This was "the equivalent of using a nuclear bomb to achieve a small tactical victory"
  - There is a good [Wired article](https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/) on it



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-nb-400" -->
## Malware Costs: Example 7
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Pumpspeicherwerk_Geesthacht_Rohre.jpg/800px-Pumpspeicherwerk_Geesthacht_Rohre.jpg)
- The [Colonial Pipeline shutdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_Pipeline_cyberattack)
  - Ransomware infected the computers of the company that supplies half of the east coast's oil and gas
  - They paid 75 bitcoin (about $5 million) to the ransomware writers (DarkSide)
  - The costs beyond that -- to regular citizens -- have not yet been estimated



## Malware Costs: Conclusion
- Computer viruses and other security attacks are very costly
- Computer security is a hot field today; many career and research opportunities for graduates from this course
- Knowledge of security issues is sensitive and carries an ethical responsibility with it
- ...but how can you write a detection software for a virus that does not exist yet?



## There are also policy motivations
- US bills [SOPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act) / [PIPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PROTECT_IP_Act) from 2011 were intended to hinder piracy, it would allow serious security problems
  - There have been many such attempts since
- US drone fleet virus (see articles [here](http://www.tgdaily.com/security-features/58927-virus-infects-us-military-drones) and [here](https://www.wired.com/2011/10/virus-hits-drone-fleet/))
  - And people thought viruses were a thing of the past!

## Cybersecurity and the last shutdown
- The [government shutdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_government_shutdown_of_2018%E2%80%932019) from early 2019 lasted 35 days
- With skeletal staffs, many gov't agencies could not perform basic cybersecurity procedures
- Thus, cybersecurity is one of many things hurt by the shutdown
- [source](https://www.rollcall.com/news/cybersecurity-efforts-may-suffer-shutdown-persists)

# Course Information
  </textarea></section>

  <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n"><textarea>
## Course Objectives
- Understand the ethical and policy context for cybersecurity in today's society
- Understand how to better safeguard one's personal computer
- Understand the basics of advanced topics in cybersecurity including encryption, digital forensics, binary exploits, and networks
- Understand the modern concepts in cybersecurity attacks and prevention



## Course Purpose
- This course is meant to be a general introduction to cybersecurity
- It is the pre-req for all the other cybersecurity courses at UVa



## Course Sources
- I am not, in fact, the first to create an Introduction to Cybersecurity course
  - Some of this course's content is based on [UMich EECS 388](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs388.f13//index.html)
    - Intel funded them to create a course under a [CC BY-SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license
  - Other parts come from online sources
    - The ethics part from [here](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/technology-ethics/resources/an-introduction-to-cybersecurity-ethics/), for example



## Class Information
- Prerequisites: CS 2150 (PDR) or (CS 2100 (DSA1) and CS 2130 (CSO1)) with a grade of C- or higher
- Grades
  - One midterm (20%) on Wednesday, March 1st, during lecture
  - Final exam (25%): on Monday, May 8th, from 2pm - 5pm
  - Homeworks (45%)
  - Class participation, pop quizzes (10%)
- I reserve the right to adjust the percentages based on the number of assignments and quizzes, and other factors



## More on that pre-requisite
- If you are are a transfer student (or a non-UVA student during the summer term), then your pre-req is all of the following:
  - two semesters of programming experience
  - knowledge of programming in C or C++
  - knowledge of programming in assembly



<!-- 
## Exams
- As mentioned, two midterms:
  - Friday, October 4th, during lecture
  - Friday, November 8th, during lecture
- Final exam
  - It's on Friday, December 13, from 2pm to 5pm
  - You can't take it early, so please don't ask
  - You can't take it late, either


-->
## Homeworks
- Late homework is docked 25% per day (or fraction thereof)
  - Thus, more than 72 hours late will receive a zero 
- Homeworks will generally be given out two per week
  - Some "easy" ones will be more often
  - Some "hard" ones will have a bit more time
- Note that the difficulty level of the homeworks varies considerably



## Us and you
- All office hours are posted on the Canvas landing page
- I avoid e-mailing the class; announcements will be discussed each day in lecture and posted to Canvas / Piazza
- To contact me, please use the support tickets tool (linked to from the main Collab page)
- We also have Piazza as well for questions



## Course Materials
- They are kept in a github repo: https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/ics
  - Released under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) (CC BY-SA) license
- That repo is viewable online at http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/ics/



## Canvas
- We'll use for:
  - Access to Gradescope for the assignment submissions
  - Piazza link
  - Large file downloads
  - Lecture recordings
  - Online meetings link
- Recall that most of the course materials are in the [github repo](https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/ics)



## Tentative schedule
- (for the summer, a class is 2 lectures of content)
- Introduction (3.5 lectures): course introduction and motivation, terminology, security mindset
- Ethics & Policy (5 lectures): ethics, policy
- Encryption (5.5 lectures): encryption, hashes
- Networks (6 lectures): networks, web security
- Binary manipulation (6 lectures): viruses, buffer overflows, binary exploits
- Modern topics (9 lectures): SQL/XSS/CSRF, anonymity, cryptocurrency, stuxnet, rootkits, VMs
- Digital forensics (3 lectures): forensics



## Homeworks
- Each module will generally have two assignments during a regular (fall/spring) semester, and less than that during a summer term
  - A written homework, submitted as a PDF
    - Will consist of writing, math, and short programs
  - A programming assignment; source code will be submitted
- Please read the [homework policies](../uva/hw-policies.html) page, as you are going to be bound by it!



## Completing the homeworks
- You can use a VirtualBox image we will provide
  - Similar to the one used in CS 2150, but updated and with a bit more software installed
- You can run it on your own computer
- Some homeworks will *require* a specific platform or language, others it will be a recommendation, and others can be done on any platform
- You can use any development environment (including IDE) that you would like



## Readings
- There is no assigned textbook
  - They get outdated too quickly!
- However, there will be readings assigned
- These readings may have pop quizzes to test that you actually read it
  - If you miss class, then you get a zero for the quiz!
  - They will be via provided PDFs and/or online materials
- Some of the "readings" may be podcasts to listen to



## What you must purchase
- Nothing
  - (there is no textbook for this course, only online materials)
- But, as it's a computer science course, you need to have a (working and recent) computer
  - If you don't, or if yours breaks, let me know, and the department can loan you one



<!--
- You have to have a network card that is compatible with [Aircrack-ng](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/) for one of the homeworks
  - If yours is not compatible (and many are not), you can buy one that is for about $20 via Amazon
  - Information on this will be provided part-way through the semester, in time for the appropriate homework
-->
## Politics
- Some of the discussion in this class will be regarding politics
  - Especially the policy discussion late next week
- Although I have strong political opinions, I have always maintained strict political neutrality when teaching my classes
  - If you ever feel this is not the case, please let me know!
- That being said, if something is stupid, I'm going to say so (generally something technology related)
  - I don't consider that politics -- just common sense



## Sensitive topics
- Cybersecurity is closely tied to spam (a common vector), which is closely tied to pornography (a common means to get clicks)
- We will be discussing these as well -- and yes, in a professional manner



## Honor policy
- All assignments are individual assignments
- You can talk at a high level about the assignment
- You cannot look at anybody else's code prior to either of your submissions
- Once you both have submitted it for the *FINAL* time, you may discuss code

# Ethics
  </textarea></section>
      
  <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n"><textarea>
## Computer Ethics
- We must teach how attacks upon computer systems work in order to teach defenses against attacks
- Information about attacks must NEVER be used to attack any computer system in any way



## Ethics Pledge
- You will have to read and sign the ethics pledge
  - It should not be difficult to follow
- Ethics will be covered in more detail later
- You cannot continue in the course without signing the ethics pledge
- I'll provide the pledge links to sign electronically in a day or two



## Ethics Pledge Points
- Unauthorized use of computer resources is forbidden
- Even malware that does nothing but copy itself uses resources
- Don't ever rationalize that a system owner won't object to your actions; ask permission
  - If you are afraid to ask permission, it must be forbidden!



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-nb-400" -->
## Example: [1988 Morris Worm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm)
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Morris_Worm.jpg)
- Creator rationalized that the worm did no damage
  - It only copied itself from system to system over the Internet
- BUT: Copying monopolized system resources until they had to be shut down
- Worm reached 10% of entire Internet
- Creator did not realize it would be that resource-intensive
- Creator was convicted of felonies!
  - And is now a professor at MIT.  Go figure!



## Morris Worm Lessons
- Consequences of a virus or worm cannot always be foreseen
- Severe damage can be done without destroying data
- Excessive resource usage is destructive enough to be criminal



## Criminal Prosecution
- Attackers have been prosecuted for:
  - Stealing passwords, even if never used 
  - Copying copyrighted materials
  - Accessing confidential data, even if it was never used for harmful purposes
  - Entering a system without permission, causing sys admins to spend time tracking them and securing the system, even without otherwise causing harm
- Moral: Don't assume it is legally safe to do any of the above



## Ethics Violations
- Violations by students endanger our ability to offer this course
- As a result, they will be treated severely
  - UJC (University Judiciary Committee)
  - Course grades
  - Criminal prosecution



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-400" -->
## ACM Code of Ethics
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Association_for_Computing_Machinery_%28ACM%29_logo.svg/768px-Association_for_Computing_Machinery_%28ACM%29_logo.svg.png)
- ACM is the primary professional organization for computer scientists
  - IEEE is the other
- The entire code is available at http://www.acm.org/about/code-of-ethics 



## Ethics Questions
- Scenario: John Doe attempts to guess the password of a user of a system on which John Doe has no account. After a few guesses, he succeeds, but finds nothing of interest on the system and logs off.
- Q1: Has he committed a crime?
- Q2: Are his actions analogous to any common crime not involving computers?
