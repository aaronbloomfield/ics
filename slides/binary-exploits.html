## Vulnerabilities and Exploits
- *Vulnerability* is often used to refer only to vulnerable code in an OS or applications
- More generally, a vulnerability is whatever weakness in an overall system makes it open to attack
- An attack that was designed to target a known vulnerability is an *exploit* of that vulnerability


## Varieties of Vulnerabilities
- Buffer overflow on stack
  - Primarily used to overwrite the return address
- Buffer overflow on heap
  - Return addresses are not on the heap
  - Other pointers are on the heap and can be overwritten, e.g. function & file pointers
- Format string attacks
- Memory management attacks
- Failure to validate input
- URL encoding failures; ... the list goes on


## Classifying Vulnerabilities
- [Szor](https://books.google.com/books?id=XE-ddYF6uhYC) classifies vulnerabilities and exploits by generation
- First generation: Stack buffer overflow
- Second generation:
	- Off by one overflows, heap overflows, file pointer overwriting, function pointer overwriting
- Third generation
	- Format string attacks, memory (heap) management attacks
	- ... the list is lengthy


## First Generation Exploits
- *Buffer overflow* is the most common exploit
  - Array bounds not usually checked at run time
- What comes *after* the buffer being overflowed determines what can be attacked
	- The return address is on the stack at a known offset after the last local variable
	- Return address can be changed to cause a return to malicious code
- Buffer overflows are easy to guard against, yet they remain the most common code vulnerability


## Stack Buffer Overflows
- As we've [seen them already](buffer-overflows.html#/), we aren't going to go over them again here

## Heap Buffer Overflow
- Example: overwriting a file pointer
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    int ch = 0, i = 0;
    FILE *f = NULL;
    static char buffer[16], *szFileName = "C:\\harmless.txt";
    ch = getchar();
    while (ch != EOF) /* User input can overflow buffer[] */
      buffer[i++] = ch;  ch = getchar();
    f = fopen(szFileName, "w+b"); /* might be modified! */
    fputs(buffer, f);
    fclose(f);
    return 0;
}
```


## Heap Buffer Overflow
- Examine the key lines of the example code:
```
static char buffer[16], *szFilename =
                   "C:\\harmless.txt";
```
- Both variables are placed in global heap (because they are static) and will be consecutive in the heap
- When `buffer[]` is overflowed with keyboard input, it will overwrite `szFilename`:
```
while (ch != EOF) { // User input can overflow buffer
    buffer[i++] = ch;
	ch = getchar();
}
```


## Heap Buffer Overflow
- An attacker who can compile the code and dump it to figure out addresses can now make `szFileName` point anywhere he wants
- For example, he could make it point to `argv[1]`; this means he can pass in a file name on the command line!
- So, the attacker passes in `C:\autoexec.bat` or some other protected system file name on the command line; if this program is a system utility that runs with admin privileges, the system file can be overwritten


## Off by One Attack
- The C language starts array indices at zero, which is not always intuitive for beginning programmers
- This often leads to off-by-one errors in code that fills a buffer
```
void vuln(char *foobar) {
    int i;
    char buffer[512];
    for (i = 0; i <= 512; ++i) // Should be <, not <=
      buffer[i] = foobar[i];
}
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    if (2 == argc)
      vuln(argv[1]);
    return 0;
}
```


## Off by One Attack
- How much damage could a one-byte exploit cause?
- It depends on what is after the buffer
  - If it's a stack canary, then there will be no effect
  - If it's the return address, then it can be a typical buffer overflow
  - It could also be the saved EBP location between them (the frame pointer)
    - The attacker cannot directly alter the return address in this case
    - S/he *can* alter the last byte of the saved EBP


## Off by One Attack
- When the vulnerable function returns, the calling function will now have a bogus stack frame
  - This bogus stack frame can be arranged to lie within the buffer that was partly filled with malicious code
  - When the caller of the vulnerable function returns, it will return into the start of the malicious code section of the buffer


## Off by One Stack Frame
- The caller of the vulnerable function ends up returning to a fake return address (inside buffer):
  - 512 bytes of `buffer[]` received malicious code, plus a bogus stack frame, from the keyboard, as hex strings
  - Byte 513 from the keyboard was the new lowest byte of the valid saved EBP
	- Lowest because the x86 is little-Endian
	- Thus making the caller's stack frame be inside `buffer[]`


## Off by One Stack Frame
<!-- .slide: class="max-image-height-500" -->
![off by one attack](images/exploits/off-by-one.png)


## Off by One: Real Examples
- [Nestea IP frame off-by-one denial of service attack](http://www.insecure.org/sploits/linux.PalmOS.nestea.html)
- [Linux fileutils "ls" command off-by-one memory exhaustion attack (system crashes)](http://www.linuxsecurity.com/content/view/105485/105/)  (registration required)
- [Middleman printer proxy server Linux attack](http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2003/01/13/insecurities.html#mid)


## Function Pointer Overwriting
- A system utility could have a function pointer to a callback function, declared after a buffer ([Szor](https://books.google.com/books?id=XE-ddYF6uhYC), Listing 10.5)
- Overflowing the buffer overwrites the function pointer
- By determining the address of system() on this machine, an attacker can cause system() to be called instead of the callback function
- [Macromedia Flash example](http://www.securiteam.com/windowsntfocus/6W00J00EKQ.html)

## Format String Attacks
- Many C library functions produce formatted output using format strings
  - e.g. `printf()`, `fprintf()`, `wprintf()`, `sprintf()`, etc.)
- These functions permit strings that have no format control to be printed (unfortunately):
```
char buffer[13] = "Hello, world!";
printf(buffer);        /* Bad programmer! */
printf("%s", buffer);  /* Good programmer! */
```


## Format String Attacks
- Consider:
```
char buffer[13] = "Hello, world!";
printf(buffer);        /* Bad programmer! */
```
- The format string (1st parameter to `printf()`) is not a fixed string
- This non-standard approach creates the possibility that an attacker will pass a format string rather than a string to print, which can be used to write to memory


## Format String Attack Example
Source code: [vuln.c](code/exploits/vuln.c) ([html](code/exploits/vuln.c.html))
```
void vuln(char buffer[256]) {
  printf(buffer); 
  /* Bad; good would be: printf("%s",buffer) */
}
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
   char buffer[256] = "";  /* allocate buffer */
   if (2 == argc)  /* copy command line */
      strncpy(buffer, argv[1], 255);
   vuln(buffer);
   return 0;
}
```
- The included [Makefile](code/exploits/Makefile) compiles this to `vuln-32bit.exe` and `vuln-64bit.exe`
- What if the user passes `%x` on the command line?


## Format String Attack Example
- For sanity sake, we will probably want to run it via:
```
setarch x86_64 -v -LR vuln-32bit.exe
setarch x86_64 -v -LR vuln-64bit.exe
```
- This isn't necessary, but it will make our lives easier
  - Since the addresses will be the same each time we run it
- And when run on the Ubuntu 16.04 VirtualBox image, your execution will match the examples in this slide set


## Format String Attack Example
- If the user passes `%x` on the command line, then printf() will receive a pointer to a string with `"%x"` in it on the stack
- `printf()` will see the `%x` and assume there is another parameter above it on the stack
- Whatever is above it on the stack will be printed in hexadecimal
- Difference between correct and incorrect uses of `printf()` is seen in next diagram


## Example: Uses of printf()
- Immediately after the call to `printf()`, but before the prologue code in `printf()`:
![format string attack](images/exploits/format-string-attack-1.png)
- This is the 32-bit version


## Example: Uses of printf()
- For the 64-bit version:
  - The return addresses are still on the stack
	- 0x4005f3 from `printf()` to `vuln()`
	- 0x40067c from `vuln()` to `main()`
  - The parameters are in registers (rdi for the first, rsi for the second, etc.)
- Note that, in both cases, there may be other values between the stack values shown


## What can we do with this?
- If we provide `%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x`, it will print the values on the stack
  - For 8-byte values, try using `%lx` instead of `%x`
- Keep in mind that the first 5 will print the register contents!
  - Wait -- why only the first 5?


## Faking printf() parameters
![format string attack](images/exploits/format-string-attack-2.png)


## Overwriting Within the Stack
- The format string can also be used to force `printf()` to write to memory via `%n`:
```
printf("foobar%n", &nBytesWritten);
```
  - This prints "foobar" and then writes 6 to `nBytesWritten`
  - We can also use `%hn` for a short, or `%ln` for a long
- Now we can start *writing* to memory, rather than just reading it...


## Writing to the stack
- If we want to write a specific value, such as a pointer address, we just have to write that many bytes to stdout
  - There are shortcuts to this: use a specifier such as `%.4196006u`
- Note that values in the buffer are *both* the parameters *AND* the values read into them
  - Thus, we can supply the address to write to


## The stack diagram again
![format string attack](images/exploits/format-string-attack-2.png)


## A vulnerability
Consider the [exploitable.c](code/exploits/exploitable.c) ([html](code/exploits/exploitable.c.html)) code:
```
int exploited() {
  printf("Got here!\n");
  exit(0);
}
int main(void) {
  char buffer[100];
  while (fgets(buffer, sizeof buffer, stdin)) {
    printf(buffer);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
- We can supply a string such that `exploited()` will be called, but we won't see that here
  - Interested in the details? Take Defense Against the Dark Arts, or see the slide set [here](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/dada/slides/15-exploits.html#/thirdgen)


## Heap Management
- A heap allocation (e.g. via `malloc()`) allocates a small control block, with pointer and size fields, just before the memory that is allocated
- An attacker can underflow the heap memory allocated (in the absence of proper bounds checking, or with pointer arithmetic) and overwrite the control block
- The heap management software will now use the overwritten memory pointer info in the control block, and can thus be redirected to write to arbitrary memory addresses


## Input Validation Failures
- There are numerous ways in which an application program can fail to validate user input
- We will examine the two failures that are most important in the Internet age:
  - URL encoding and canonicalization
    - http://domain.tld/passwords.txt is not allowed by the webserver, but http://domain.tld/user/../passwords.txt may bypass naive security checks


## Input Validation Failures
- There are numerous ways in which an application program can fail to validate user input
- We will examine the two failures that are most important in the Internet age:
  - MIME header parsing
    - Exploit: Make an attachment of MIME type audio/x-wav but make the file name be virus.exe. 
	- This was a bug in IE back in 2001 which allowed [W32/Badtrans](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2001-112410-5327-99) and [W32/Klez](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2002-041714-3225-99) could exploit it.

# Miscellaneous Vulnerabilities
	  </textarea></section>
	  
	  <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n$"><textarea data-template>
## Miscellaneous Vulnerabilities
- Mistakes by system administrators, users, bad default security levels in applications software or firewalls, etc., can all create vulnerabilities
- Most exploits (including all 3 generations) are referred to as *blended attacks*
  - Because there is always a mixture of an exploit and a particular type of malicious code
  - e.g. overflowing a buffer is an exploit, but depositing a virus and running it is the second stage of the blended attack
- We will review some non source code examples


## System Administration Vulnerabilities
- Failure to provide secure utilities
	- e.g. SSL/SSH remote login utilities were not commonly used a decade ago
- Loose file system access rights and user privilege levels
	- many users have no idea that everyone can read many of their files
	- or the 4th octal digit of chmod permissions


## System Administration Vulnerabilities
- Errors in firewall configuration ([Szor](https://books.google.com/books?id=XE-ddYF6uhYC), sec. 14.3)
	- Allows attackers unauthorized access
	- Permits denial of service attacks to continue instead of excluding the flood of packets


## User Behavior Vulnerabilities
- Poor password selection
  - Too short; all alphabetic; common words
  - 1988 Morris worm used a list of only 432 common passwords, and succeeded in cracking many user accounts all over the internet
  - This was the main reason the worm spread more than the creator thought it would; he did not realize that password selection was that bad!
- Opening executable email attachments


## Vulnerabilities: Do We Ever Learn?
- All of these vulnerabilities have been known for years -- buffer overflows for over 40 years!
- Yet, the number of exploits is increasing
	- 323 buffer overflow vulnerabilities reported in 2004 to the national cyber-security vulnerability database (http://nvd.nist.gov/)
	- 331 buffer overflow vulnerabilities reported in just the first 6 months of 2005!
	- They don't bother to keep track anymore...


## Avoiding Vulnerabilities
- Good password selection
	- Many newer systems even allow pass phrases, i.e. multiple words with punctuation or blanks between
	- System should try its own dictionary attack and not permit you to choose a password that can be defeated
- Don't store a password unencrypted anywhere in a system, even in a temporary variable in a program


## Avoiding Vulnerabilities
- Don't open executable email attachments
- Review access permissions throughout your file directory structure
- Display and review your firewall settings

## Compiler-Based Prevention
- One approach: Modify the C language itself with a new compiler and runtime library, as in the [Cyclone variant of C](http://www.research.att.com/projects/cyclone/)
  - Overhead for bounds checking, garbage collection, library safeguards, etc., ranges from negligible to >100% for the worst cases
- Another approach: leave the language alone, but modify the compiler to emit stack and/or buffer overflow safeguards in the executable
	- Examples we will see: StackGuard, ProPolice, and StackShield


## StackGuard: Stack Canaries
- StackGuard inserts a marker in between the frame pointer and the return address on the stack
	- Marker is called a `canary`, as in the "canary in a coal mine"
- If a buffer overflow overwrites the stack all the way to the return address, it will also overwrite the canary
- Before returning, the canary is examined for modification


## Stack Canary Operation
<!-- .slide: class="max-image-height-300" -->
![canary stack](images/exploits/canary-stack.png)
- Overflowing `buffer[]` tramples on canary
- Does not prevent trashing the EBP (or RBP), local function or file pointers, etc.
- Canary value: NUL-CR-LF-EOF; very difficult to write out from a string


## ProPolice: Better Stack Canaries and Frame Layout
- ProPolice (a.k.a. SSP, Stack-Smashing Protector) from IBM makes a couple of major improvements to StackGuard
	- Canary is placed below the saved EBP to protect it
	- The stack frame layout is rearranged so that non-array locals, such as function pointers and file pointers, are placed below arrays, so that overflowing the arrays cannot reach the pointers


## Stack Canary Limitations
- Stack canaries only guard against a *direct* attack on the stack, e.g. overwriting a portion of the stack directly from its neighboring addresses
- We saw that a format string attack is *indirect*: it computes the location of the return address, then overwrites just that address and does not overflow from neighboring addresses
	- Hence, it does not overwrite a canary


## StackShield: Protecting Return Addresses
- StackShield is a Linux/gcc add-on that modifies the ASM output from gcc to maintain a separate data segment with return addresses
- Removing the return addresses from the data stack prevents both direct and indirect data attacks on the return address


## StackShield: Protecting Return Addresses
- Also computes the range of valid code addresses and performs a range check on all function calls and returns
	- A call to, or return into, a data area will be detected as invalid because of the address range


## Operating System Defenses
- Don't allow execution in the stack
  - Exploit could still execute code from the heap or other global data area
- Instead of read and write permission bits on pages, add an execute permission bit and set it to false on all data pages (heap, stack, etc.)
	- This is supported in hardware on the Intel x86-64 architecture and in the versions of Microsoft Windows (from XP onward) that run on it


## Case Study: Slapper Worm
- The 2002 worm known as [Linux/Slapper](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2002-091311-5851-99) was a very complex attack on heap buffer overflow vulnerabilities within the Apache web server
- Vulnerability: In secure mode (i.e. on an https:// connection under SSL [Secure Socket Layer]), Apache copied the client's master key into a fixed-length buffer `key_arg[]` that was just big enough to hold a valid 8-byte key
  - But didn't do any bounds checking, even though the key length is passed as a second parameter with the key


## Case Study: Slapper Worm
- Exploit: Pass in a long key and key length, such that a certain magic address is overwritten


## Slapper: The Magic Address
- The magic address that Slapper wanted to overwrite was the GOT (Global Offset Table) entry for the `free()` function
	- GOT is the Unix/ELF equivalent of the IAT (Import Address Table) in a Windows PE file; Slapper is therefore an IAT modifying EPO worm
	- I.e. If you redirect the GOT entry for free(), then calls into the C run-time library that should have gone into free() are now redirected to a new address


## Slapper: The Magic Address
- The relative distance from the key_arg[] buffer to the GOT entry for `free()` differs among Apache revisions and among different Linux revisions for which Apache was compiled
- The Slapper author computed the addresses and distances across 23 (!) different combinations of Apache revision/Linux system


## Slapper: The Magic Address
- The first client message the worm sends is a request for Apache to identify its revision number and the Linux system version code (a legitimate request, as Apache services can depend on these numbers)
  - The exploit code was then tuned for the particular revision/system
-  Ultimately, Slapper ran its own shellcode on the server system, with Apache privileges, when Apache executed a call to `free()`
- See [Szor](https://books.google.com/books?id=XE-ddYF6uhYC), 10.4.4, for lots more details
