## Forensics
> **forensics** (plural in form but singular or plural in construction): the application of scientific knowledge to legal problems
>
> *especially*: scientific analysis of physical evidence (as from a crime scene)

- [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/forensic)



## What is a forensic science?
- It is any science that can be applied to the *analysis* of an accident or crime scene
  - Formally, it is any science applied to criminal and civil laws
- (some of the examples on the following slides are from [here](https://www.pdsd.org/cms/lib6/PA01000989/Centricity/ModuleInstance/1582/Chapter_1.ppt))



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-600" -->
## Forensic science: Pathology
[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/13-11-12-rechtsmedizin-berlin-charite-by-RalfR-20.jpg/800px-13-11-12-rechtsmedizin-berlin-charite-by-RalfR-20.jpg)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:13-11-12-rechtsmedizin-berlin-charite-by-RalfR-20.jpg)
- How did the<br>person die?
- This includes:
  - cause of death
  - drugs, poisons,<br>alcohol in blood
  - manner of death
  - performing an<br>autopsy



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-600" -->
## Forensic science: Anthropology
[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Exhumed_skeletal_remains_of_victims_of_the_Isaaq_genocide.jpg/800px-Exhumed_skeletal_remains_of_victims_of_the_Isaaq_genocide.jpg)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Exhumed_skeletal_remains_of_victims_of_the_Isaaq_genocide.jpg)
- For skeletal remains:
  - are they human?
  - if so, what is the<br>age, sex, race?
  - any injuries to the<br>bones?
  - facial reconstruction<br>based on the skull



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-800" -->
## Forensic science: Odontology
[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Dental_X-ray_70.JPG/400px-Dental_X-ray_70.JPG)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dental_X-ray_70.JPG)
- Odontology == dentistry
- Identify remains based<br>on dental records
- Match a suspect to a<br>bite mark injury



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-600" -->
## Forensic science: Engineering
[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/1994%EC%84%B1%EC%88%98%EB%8C%80%EA%B5%90_%EB%B6%95%EA%B4%B4_%EC%82%AC%EA%B3%A017.jpg/800px-1994%EC%84%B1%EC%88%98%EB%8C%80%EA%B5%90_%EB%B6%95%EA%B4%B4_%EC%82%AC%EA%B3%A017.jpg)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:1994%EC%84%B1%EC%88%98%EB%8C%80%EA%B5%90_%EB%B6%95%EA%B4%B4_%EC%82%AC%EA%B3%A017.jpg)
- Typically for mechanical<br>or structural issues<br>or accidents
  - Why did it fail?
- For traffic accidents,<br>reconstruction of the<br>accident



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-800" -->
## Forensic science: Entomology
[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Anastrepha_ludens_1322088.jpg/400px-Anastrepha_ludens_1322088.jpg)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Anastrepha_ludens_1322088.jpg)
- Entomology is the study<br>of insects
- Many insects lay eggs in<br>decaying flesh
- But different insects do<br>this at different times
- By studying the insect eggs<br>in a corpse, the time since<br>death can be estimated



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-600" -->
## Forensic science: Biology
[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/A-B-Z-DNA_Side_View.png)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:A-B-Z-DNA_Side_View.png)
- DNA tests, typically of<br>DNA-based evidence
  - Blood on the victim,<br>or semen in the case<br>of rapes
  - Even flesh under the<br>fingernails of a victim



## And many other fields
- Art history: to determine art forgeries
- Chemistry: illegal drug analysis
- Geology: evidence in soils, etc.
- And, of course, computer science
- See a full list on Wikipedia's [Forensic science page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science)

## Stages
[![write-blocker](images/forensics/640px-Portable_forensic_tableau.jpg)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Portable_forensic_tableau.JPG)
1. Acquisition of evidence
   - Imaging a hard drive<br>or USB key, often via<br>a "write-blocker"
   - [One is $389 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q76XG5W)
   - And others...
2. Analysis
   - The real work here...
3. Report
   - Often must hold up<br>in court!



## Evidence acquisition
- Most common is to image a hard drive or USB key
  - Technically, this is *media forensics*
- Other possibilities:
  - Physical evidence of the computer/media
  - Recording network packets
  - Social media account analysis
  - Use of "cloud" services, including smart speakers
- We will primarily focus on drive images



## History
- 1980's: specialized groups of individuals who did this type of analysis
- 1990's: more national groups, growth of the field, initial tools
- 2000's: better tools, guidelines, related laws and court rulings, training initiatives
- 2010's: better AI in tools, use of cloud, better virtualization options



## Motivating example
- A corporate exec named Tony is working on a new technology "X"
  - He leaves to join a competing company
  - Suddenly, that company has made a lot of advancements in technology "X"
- Did Tony leave with any documents from your company?
  - How could you tell?



## This really happened
- In January 2016, Anthony Levandowski left Google's self driving car unit
  - Was immediately hired as head of Otto's self driving car unit
    - Otto was later acquired by Uber
- Google sued Uber
  - Case was settled for $245 million in early 2018



## Background: filesystems
- Filesystems keep the file contents and also the *metadata*
  - Timestamps, owners, permissions, file type, etc.
  - Plus the directory structure
- When a file is deleted, typically only the directory entry is removed
  - The blocks that the file took up are marked as available, but are not wiped

# Techniques
  </textarea>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n">
  <textarea data-template>
## Deleted file recovery
- Undelete programs search hard drivers sectors for file blocks
  - If the blocks have not been overwritten, then the file can be successfully restored
- Some times only parts can be recovered
- Secure delete programs can (often) solve this
- Linux: see next slide



## Deleted file recovery (Linux)
- Under Linux, use testdisk or photorec
  - Some programs, such as autopsy, cannot properly undelete files (we'll see autopsy shortly)
  - [testdisk](https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk) will be useful to find the file(s) to be undeleted, but cannot undelete them
  - Use photorec for the undeletion itself -- note that it undeletes *all* files, so you will need about 11 Gb of free space
    - Then find the file(s) by their extension



## Password protected files
- Various password crackers exist for many means of password protecting files
  - Example: the .zip password cracker used in the [Networks HW](../hws/hw-networks.html)
- One can encrypt / decrypt files with AES as well:
    - `openssl aes-256-cbc -a -salt -in input.txt -out input.txt.aes`
    - `openssl aes-256-cbc -d -a -salt -in input.txt.aes -out output.txt`



## Image search
- Some illegal activity involves images and videos
  - Child porn, in particular
- While programs exist to find images that look like something else, a manual search is likely the most viable
  - One can view a page of thumbnails to quickly search through an image library
- JPEG images also have EXIF data, which has textual information about the image
  - exiftool and jhead are tools that can extract EXIF data



## Keyword search
- Some OSes can do this from a file browser
  - Windows Explorer, for example
- Others may require indexing the files
  - Mac's spotlight search is a good example of this
  - Linux has baloo which is similar, for indexing
    - Or `grep` to find text within files
- Intelligent OSes & applications can read into .zip files, JPEG EXIF data, etc.



## Browser history
- Not everybody uses ~~porn~~ privacy mode on their web browser
- In-browser instructions are [readily available](https://www.wikihow.com/View-Browsing-History)
- This can be done by the command line as well



## Browser cache
- All browsers support searching through this
  - Firefox: view `about:cache`
  - Chrome: various [cache viewers exist](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/chrome_cache_view.html)
  - Similarly for other browsers
- The files are also on the hard drive
  - Windows/Chrome example:  `C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\ Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Cache`



## Email search
- Either a keyword or filesystem search, as above, or...
  - Just loading up the email client and using that to search
- A legal warrant can also obtain information from the mail provider



## Network connection search
- DNS entries are cached for a period of time
  - Try running `ipconfig /displaydns` under Windows, for example
  - This lists websites contacted
- Many Linux distributions do not do DNS caching by default
  - Ubuntu, in particular



## Other places to look
- In the /tmp folder
  - This is cleared upon boot, but not upon shutdown
- In the command history (likely ~/.bash_history)
- In databases on the drive
  - You can also view the history of SQL commands, such as in .mysql_history

  <textarea data-template>
## Encrypted Drives
- A properly encrypted drive...
  - ... meaning a good cipher and a good password...
- ... cannot reasonably be cracked
- "In October [2017], FBI Director Christopher Wray said that in an 11-month period, the FBI had been unable to extract data from more than 6,900 devices; that is over half of the devices it had attempted to unlock" ([source](https://www.lawfareblog.com/fifth-amendment-decryption-and-biometric-passcodes))




## Encrypted Drives
- If you have an encrypted hard drive, and the gov't has a (valid) search warrant...
  - You can't refuse on 1st amendment (free speech) grounds 
  - Analogy: you can't refuse to unlock a door on your house if the police have a (valid) search warrant based on free speech grounds
	- Granted, they have battering rams...



## Encrypted Drives
- What about the 5th amendment (can't force self-incrimination)?
  - This *sometimes* can work
  - That amendment only applies to *testimonials*, not actions
	- But is forcing you to decrypt your hard drive an action or a testimonial?
- That depends on the *foregone conclusion doctrine*
  - If the gov't already knows what is there (at the time of the attempted search!), then it's an action; if not, it's a testimonial



## Foregone Conclusion Doctrine
- In USA vs. Fricosu (2012), the defendant was forced to decrypt
  - Fricosu admitted on a recorded phone call that there was "stuff" on the machine
- In USA vs. Doe (2012), the defendant was *not* forced to decrypt
  - The gov't didn't know what was there
  - The court rejected the notion "that simply because the devices were encrypted necessarily means that Doe was trying to hide something"
- Sources: [WaPo](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/06/07/the-fifth-amendment-limits-on-forced-decryption-and-applying-the-foregone-conclusion-doctrine/), [EFF](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/03/tale-two-encryption-cases)



## Self-incrimination
- Courts have held that self-incrimination is the act of stating you are guilty
  - Formally, a *testimonial communication* that is incriminating
- Using information about you does not qualify
  - So the 5th amendment does not allow you to prevent biometric scans, fingerprint readers, etc.
- [Source](https://www.lawfareblog.com/fifth-amendment-decryption-and-biometric-passcodes)



## Other use of encryption
- https blocks packet sniffing
- Tor prevents geolocation based on IP address
  - And uses https
  - Tor browsers do not cache files locally (or even write to disk)



## Mobile device encryption
- You can configure your phone to delete everything unless a pass code is entered in the first 10 tries
  - And encrypt it as well
- It is not viable to crack recent phones secured with this



## [FBI-Apple encryption dispute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI%E2%80%93Apple_encryption_dispute)
- A phone from one of the shooters in the [2015 terrorist attack in San Bernardino, CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_San_Bernardino_attack), that killed 14 people, used an iPhone 5C's encryption
- The FBI wanted Apple to electronically sign software that would enable the FBI to unlock the phone
- Apple refused, and it went to court



## [FBI-Apple encryption dispute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI%E2%80%93Apple_encryption_dispute)
- Note that the FBI was not asking Apple to unlock that one phone...
  - ... which is something that Apple had been helping law enforcement do for years (with a proper warrant)
- Instead, they wanted Apple to put in a backdoor that the FBI could use on *any* iPhone
  - And without Apple's knowledge or assistance
  - Note that Apple was already helping them unlock the phone



## [FBI-Apple encryption dispute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI%E2%80%93Apple_encryption_dispute)
- The FBI likely felt they had a weak case
- Right before the hearing, they delayed
  - The reason: they found a third party that could do this for them
    - By booting it into "debug mode" via a USB connection
- Apple fixed this issue in the next release
- This case never went back to court



## [FBI-Apple encryption dispute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI%E2%80%93Apple_encryption_dispute)
- The phone in question had no useful information, as it turned out
- Other court rulings have generally said that Apple can not be compelled to unlock an iPhone
- It has been opined that the [reason is more financial](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/what-is-the-real-reason-apple-wont-unlock-the-san-bernardino-killers-iphone-a6884581.html) than ethical for Apple in this case

# System Analysis and Tools
  </textarea>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n">
  <textarea data-template>
## Basic UNIX commands: strings
- Given a binary file, run `strings` on that file to extract all ASCII strings in that file
  - By default, it's all consecutive printable ASCII characters of length 4 or greater
  - The -n option can change this: 
  ```console
  strings -n 10 filename
  ```



## Basic UNIX commands: grep
- Searches a file for text
  ```console
  grep foobar filename
  ```
- Case insensitive by adding -i
- All files *not* matching the string via -v
- `egrep` uses regular expressions:
  ```console
  egrep -i 'apple|banana|orange' *
  ```



## Basic UNIX commands: find
- Find files in sub-directories based on specific criteria, such as filename:
  ```console
  find / -name "*.foo"
  ```
  - That searches the root directory (`/`)
- or by file contents:
  ```console
  find . -type f -exec grep "example" '{}' \; -print
  ```
  - Finds files (`-type f`) and runs `grep` on them to search for `example` within
  - That searches the current directory (`.`)



## Modern Forensics Tools
- There are lots of them out there
  - A [Google search for "top digital forensics tools"](https://www.google.com/search?q=top+digital+forensics+tools) returns a lot of hits
- There are [lots of free and open source tools](https://techtalk.gfi.com/top-20-free-digital-forensic-investigation-tools-for-sysadmins/)
- Wikipedia even has [an article listing many of these tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_digital_forensics_tools)



## Autopsy / Sleuth Kit
- The tool is [Sleuth Kit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sleuth_Kit), the GUI is [Autopsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy_(software%29)
- They are both open source
- Due to Java incompatabilities, and software rot, it does not seem to install properly under Linux



## Autopsy / Sleuth Kit
![autopsy screen shot](images/forensics/autopsy.png)



## Autopsy / Sleuth Kit
- More recent versions have a Java GUI
[![autopsy screen shot](images/forensics/autopsy-v4.png)](https://github.com/sleuthkit/autopsy/issues/2855)



## Other tools
- To find deleted files, try [debugfs](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/80270/unix-linux-undelete-recover-deleted-files) or [testdisk](https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk)
  - I like the latter better, but your mileage may vary
  - Sometimes they can recover files that autopsy cannot
- You can use equivalent undelete programs on other operating systems for the [forensics HW](../hws/hw-forensics.html)

</section>

<section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n">
  <textarea data-template>
## Some we've seen (or will see)
- The analysis of [Stuxnet](../slides/stuxnet.html#/)
- The [FBI-Apple encryption dispute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI%E2%80%93Apple_encryption_dispute)
- The [Sony BMG rootkit fiasco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_BMG_copy_protection_rootkit_scandal) from the [rootkits](../slides/rootkits.html#/) slide set




## [Dennis Rader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Rader) (2005)
- A serial killer on the run for 30 years, he killed at least 10 victims
  - He killed again in 2005 in Kansas
- Sent a floppy disk to the police with a letter on it
  - Because floppies can't be traced
- A deleted Word file's metadata showed that the last person to edit the file was "Dennis" with a link to the church where he was a deacon
  - He is now in jail for life



## Corey Melton (2005)
- His computer was infected by viruses, so he brought it into the Geek Squad at Best Buy
- They found it was a prolific infection, and the viruses were "re-attaching themselves to movies"
  - I have no idea what that means, either
- Regardless, the Geek Squad looked at the movies, which were child porn
  - He was arrested and served 10 years in jail
- [Source](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/category/computerforensics/introduction/notable-computer-forensics-cases/#gref)



## Ownership of Facebook (2010)
- Paul Ceglia sued Mark Zuckerberg, claiming that Paul hired Mark to develop "The Page Book" -- which became facebook -- and thus owned 50%
- The court allowed facebook to do forensic testing on Ceglia's computer
- The findings:
  - An original file of the contract had no mention of "The Page Book"
  - An apparently forged .tif document of the contract was found
- The case was dismissed and Ceglia was arrested
- [source](https://www.digital-strata.com/articles/two-famous-cases-where-digital-evidence-was-key/)
