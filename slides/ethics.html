# Ethical Questions
  </textarea>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n">
  <textarea data-template>
## Question 1: What if Google were out to get you?
- Imagine that you were the mortal enemy of Larry Page or Sergey Brin
  - The founders of Google
- How much damage could they do to you?
  - Control the information that you see?
  - How much does Google know about you?
  - How much access to your private digital life does Google have, beyond Gmail?
- There are few laws that regulate any of this!



## Question 1: What if Google were out to get you?
- So why doesn't Google do this?
  - Well, Brin and Page are not evil (although this is debated: [1](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/21/google-seems-to-have-removed-most-mentions-of-dont-be-evil-from-its-code-of-conduct.html), [2](https://www.engadget.com/2018/05/24/google-will-always-do-evil/), [3](https://www.infoworld.com/article/2610434/cringely/google--evil--you-have-no-idea.html), etc.)
  - Actually, they do [do some of these things in other countries](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/technology/china-google-censored-search-engine.html)
- Beyond not being evil, few people would use their services if they were known to do these things



## Question 2: [Trolley Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem)
<img alt="trolley problem" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Trolley_problem.png" style="height:200px">
- You see a runaway trolley moving toward five tied-up people lying on the tracks
- You are next to a lever that controls a switch
- If you pull the lever, the trolley will be redirected onto a side track and the five people on the main track will be saved



## Question 2: [Trolley Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem)
<img alt="trolley problem" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Trolley_problem.png" style="height:200px">
- However, there is a single person lying on the side track
  - Option 1: Do nothing and allow the trolley to kill the five people on the main track
  - Option 2: Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person
- Which is the most ethical option?



## Is the Trolley problem realistic?
- Imagine you are writing self driving car software
- The car, which has one passenger, is about to run over five people
  - It could continue straight, and kill those people
  - Or it could swerve and likely kill the "driver"
- This is the modern version of the trolley problem
- Yes, this means your car could be programmed to kill you in the right circumstance...



## Question 3: Another variation
- Imagine you somehow knew that an individual would inadvertently kill another person
- Would you kill them to prevent this?
  - Assume that nobody would have this foreknowledge, and you would be branded a murderer
<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">What if the person would inadvertently kill 5 others?  10?  100?  A million?</li>
<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">What if this were inadvertent?</li><ul><li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">Meaning the individual would murder those other(s)</li></ul>



## Question 4: FBI & Apple Encryption Dispute
- The 2 who caused the [2015 San Bernardino attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_San_Bernardino_attack) that killed 14 used encryption on their iPhone 5C
  - The FBI was unable to crack it at the time
- The FBI ordered Apple to *write a program* to crack it, but Apple refused
  - It could allow mass surveillance and persecution of others
    - Especially if it leaked out of US control
- Apple refused, citing privacy and ethics
- This is the [FBI-Apple encryption dispute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI%E2%80%93Apple_encryption_dispute)



## Question 4: FBI & Apple Encryption Dispute
- What were Apple's ethical requirements?
  - While one can agree or disagree with Apple, there are definitely arguments on both sides
- Ultimately, it was discovered that one can hack into these phones via booting it through the USB port
  - This "feature" has been removed on more recent iPhones
- However, Apple's [appeal to public more about protecting market share than privacy, says UAlberta ethics professor](https://www.folio.ca/apple-vs-fbi-and-the-ethics-of-encryption/)



## Question 5: Gov't Leaks
- Are leaks from within the government unethical?
  - Such as leaks from within the White House, etc.
- Consider how partisan of a world we live in...
- For members of the *same* party as the president:
  - *Yes, they are unethical!  Those perpetrators should be caught and thrown in jail!*
- For members of the *opposite* party as the president:
  - *No, they are not!  They are revealing what an awful regime is running the country!*
- This has happened to previous administrations as well, to varying degrees



## Lessons Learned
- Question 1: Google
  - Companies with a lot of power can do greater damage with unethical choices
- Question 2: Trolley
  - Not all of these have correct answers (or even widely accepted answers)
- Question 3: Stopping a murderer
  - All these questions have thresholds




## Lessons Learned
- Question 4: FBI & Apple
  - Allowing a "crack" on encryption can have unintended consequences
  - Companies that state they are making the ethical choice may only be making the best financial choice
- Question 5: 
  - Reasonable people will have different views as to what is "ethical"

# Ethical Issues
  </textarea>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n">
  <textarea data-template>
## What is Ethics?
> Ethics is a branch of philosophy that involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong conduct

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics)

> the most important thing is not life, but the good life

- Socrates



## Ethics helps stabilize society
- Obvious examples: don't kill, don't steal, etc.
- As a result, all major religions and societies have these rules
  - Secular and sacred laws follow these ethics: don't kill, don't steal, etc.
- They help us live a "good life", as per Socrates
- Separate from moral arguments, ethics is a matter of self-preservation
  - Keep others from harming you



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-800" -->
## With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility
![spider man image](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61yJKZIJqjL.jpg)
- Technology gives us great<br>power
  - To accomplish a lot,<br>to harm others
- The quote is [more likely<br>from the period of the<br>French Revolution](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/07/23/great-power/)



## Technological Dependence
- We are increasingly becoming more dependent on technology
- If it were used in ways that could harm us, then that would have a much greater effect than it would have decades ago
  - See: [Facebook and the 2016 election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media_in_the_United_States_presidential_election,_2016)



## Inability to keep up
- With the rapid change of technological advancement, it is not realistic to have laws force ethical behavior
  - Lawmakers don't understand technology
  - Change is faster than laws can realistically be passed
  - Poor law wording can have wide-ranging negative effects
- Thus, various organizations have their own ethics policies, including the [ACM Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) and [IEEE's technological ethics division](https://techethics.ieee.org/)



## Ethics and Cybersecurity
- Design of cybersecurity systems seeks to protect:
  - Integrity
  - Functionality
  - Reliability
  - Etc.
- As designers, we want to ensure that we are designing systems that:
  - Are as safe as possible
  - Do not have intentional backdoors or means for improper surveillance



## How can harm result?
- Beyond intentional backdoors and such...
- From poor programming or deliberate unethical choices
  - Note that the poor design choices are considered unethical when people depend on the system in some way
  - People have gone to jail for poor design of systems, both computer and otherwise, in these situations
- Can you go to jail for coding?



## How can harm result?
- Can you go to jail for coding?
- Note that this is poor programming to the point of being *negligent*
  - Not just a coding mistake
- However, it is ethical to ensure that your system works via tests and testing suites



## Ethical Issues in Cybersecurity
- Harm to privacy
- Harm to property
- Cybersecurity costs
- Transparency and disclosure
- Roles, duties, and interests



## Harm to privacy
- Beyond just embarrassment at your porn viewing history, that is...
- Consider:
  - Identity theft, including financial account theft
    - The most common of these, since there is money to be obtained through this
  - Social ostracisation
  - Blackmail
  - Extortion
  - Theft of state secrets



## Harm to property
- Loss of funds from a financial account
- Perhaps digital property (loss of data)
- Some machines can be damaged via malware; this happened as early as 1999 via the [Chernobyl virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIH_virus)
- Connected weapon systems can damage property (and people!)
  - Think of [Skynet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator%29) from the [Terminator franchise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(franchise%29)
  - Luckily not many exist (yet)...



## Cybersecurity costs
- Too much security, and the system becomes unusable
  - Consider a system that needs to be accessed quickly: emergency response systems
- Too little, and the system is too insecure
- This decision is an ethical one, balancing between these two factors
  - Companies hire [business ethicists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_ethics) for this purpose
- There is no one-size-fits-all correct answer to this!



## Transparency and disclosure
- If a vulnerability is found, how soon to notify?
  - Perhaps not all that soon if it's hard to find, or if no patch yet exists
  - Otherwise, notify right away
- This decision is an ethical one, balancing between these two factors
- There is no one-size-fits-all correct answer to this!



## Roles, duties, and interests
- Consider conflicts of interest:
  - Wanting to release an encryption vulnerability to help promote a better algorithm
  - Hiring an ethically deficient person to try to turn them to the light side of the Force
- Are these ethically allowed?
- This decision is an ethical one, balancing between these two factors
- There is no one-size-fits-all correct answer to this!

# Public Obligations
  </textarea>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n">
  <textarea data-template>
## Legal Responsibility
- Outside of cybersecurity...
- If you see somebody that is dying, and you have the ability to save them, are you *legally* required to help?
  - We are ignoring *moral* or *ethical* concerns here...
</ul></li><li class="fragment">The answer is no, unless you have a legal responsibility to act (on duty lifeguard, on duty police officer, etc.)</li>



## Legal Responsibility
- What about within a computational context?
- As the quality of the code that we write can have consequences on things of value...
  - money, privacy, lives, etc...
- ...we do, in fact, have an *ethical* responsibility to act
  - Here 'to act' means do a sufficient job and ensure the quality of our code
- But there is limited *legal* responsibility
  - Mostly due to the laws not keeping up
- This excludes outright negligence, though



## The Public Good
- Cybersecurity professionals certainly serve the public good:
  - Help create cryptosystems to secure data
  - Ensure safety of online systems
  - Protect privacy
  - Etc.



## Affecting the public...

(courtesy of Mark Sherriff's CS 3240 slides)



## Stakeholders
- There are many stakeholders involved, but the primary ones are:
  - The users of the system, who want it to be secure
  - The entity paying for the development, who wants to keep costs down
- These create conflicting goals: security versus low cost
  - It is a balancing act to find the right balance between the two

# Ethical Frameworks
  </textarea>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n">
  <textarea data-template>
## So where are we?
- We can assume that we now understand the issues involved, who the public is, the stakeholders, etc.
- How, then, do we make ethical decisions?
- There are no clear guidelines for how to balance these things



## So where are we?
- We'll have to make decisions on a case-by-case basis
- We see four frameworks to help us make these decisions
  - Virtue Ethics
  - Consequentialist Ethics
  - Utilitarian Ethics
  - Deontological ethics



## Virtue Ethics
- Rather than right or wrong...
  - Or good actions and bad actions...
- ...this focuses on what a virtuous person would do
- So what would a 'morally excellent person' do?
  - Examples: habit of moderation, virtue of prudence, practical wisdom, etc.
- This is a *thought experiment* to be considered



## Virtue Ethics
- How does this help?
- Three ways:
  - Help us understand if we have a moral and ethical obligation, and if so, then to who
  - Help us determine which (moral and ethical) standards to follow
  - Helps us cultivate practical wisdom and good judgment



## Virtue Ethics
- These can be culturally relative
- Consider a benign example of this cultural relativity:
  - Aristotle proposed nine important virtues: wisdom, prudence, justice, fortitude, courage, liberality, magnificence, magnanimity, and temperance
  - A modern ethicist proposed four: ambition/humility, love, courage, and honesty



## Virtue Ethics
- These can be culturally relative
- Consider a non-benign example of this cultural relativity:
  - Sexism or racism: in the past, this was accepted as an accepted part of society
    - Think of societies where slavery exists, or women are second-class citizens
    - They exist today!  They are not all in the past!



## Consequentialist Ethics
- Consider what the consequences of our actions will be
  - Also called [Consequentialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism)
- "[A morally right action is one that will produce a good outcome or consequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism)"
- Do the ends justify the means?
  - An extreme interpretation of Consequentialism
  - Like how terrorism is an extreme interpretation of religion



## Utilitarian ethics
- Consider what the 'greatest good' is
  - Here, 'good' is happiness, pleasure, or absence of pain (emotional, physical, etc.)
- Many utilitarians believe that a society that maximizes individual rights and justice leads to the greatest common good (in the long run)



## Utilitarian ethics
- Gross National Happiness: a real-world application of Utilitarian ethics
- A philosophy that guides the government of [Bhutan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_National_Happiness)
> [Gross National Happiness is] an index which is used to measure the collective happiness and well-being of a population

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_National_Happiness)



## Utilitarian ethics
- Would an action that hurt one person but helped society be valid ethically?
  - Consider eminent domain seizure of property to build a highway
- What if it were a great injustice to an individual?
  - All these frameworks can be abused in the extreme



## Deontological ethics
- A rule-based or principle-based system
  - Some set of rules or principles inform us of our moral obligations
- Examples:
  - The ten commandments of the Abrahamic religions
  - A set of (secular) laws in a modern society
  - The idea of universal human rights
  - Kant's Categorical imperative
    - Only act in a way that everybody else should act



## Deontological ethics
- But what if the laws are immoral?
  - Again, consider societies where slavery or sexism exists
    - Or other forms of discrimination



## Abuses of ethical frameworks
- All these frameworks can be abused in the extreme
  - Virtue ethics: can be culturally relative
  - Consequentialist ethics: do the ends justify the means?
  - Utilitarian ethics: sacrifice one individual's rights for the good of the many
  - Deontological ethics: what if the laws are immoral?



## How to proceed
- Consider multiple frameworks
  - An abuse of one framework is likely not permissible in another framework
- These things will take time to figure out!

# Best Practices
  </textarea>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n">
  <textarea data-template>
## Cybersecurity, not compliance
- ***Keep Cybersecurity Ethics in the Spotlight -- and Out of the Compliance Box***
- Don't think of ethics as a compliance issue
  - Instead, make these decisions an integral part of what you do
- Compliance indicates following the legal framework, which often does not keep up
  - It is often that what is legal is unethical
  - Less often, what is ethical is illegal



## Consider interests involved
- ***Consider the Human Lives and Interests Behind the Systems***
- It's easy to forget that there are actual people affected by our work
  - Especially with cybersecurity issues



## Consider associated risks
- ***Consider Downstream (and Upstream and Lateral) Risks in Cybersecurity Practice***
- After we are done with something, there may still be ethical issues involved
  - Does a poor design cause people to not have reasonable security?
- This is an ethical basis for forced OS updates
  - Somebody patched the vulnerability, but that doesn't mean the work is done
  - Downstream users may not patch in time, hence the forced update



## Understand the other side
- ***Don't Discount Non-Technical Actors, Interests, Expectations, and Exposures***
- We are computer experts, and are unlikely to fall for, say, a phishing attempt
  - But non-experts will, so have your mail software attempt to block them
- Consider Microsoft's habit of [blaming the victim](https://apnews.com/33fc4e6820034fc7859e94311e5706eb) when malware occurs because patches weren't installed
  - Some users don't even know what a patch is!



## Responsibility & Accountability
- ***Establish Chains of Ethical Responsibility and Accountability***
- Who is *responsible* for ensuring ethical issues?
  - This is the entity who should do it right in the first place
- Who is *accountable* for ensuring ethical issues?
  - This is the entity that ensures that rules and ethics are followed
  - Needs to have some authority over those responsible



## Disaster planning
- ***Practice Cybersecurity Disaster Planning and Crisis Response***
- Anticipate failure -- it's going to happen
- Plan for a disaster, so if one happens, you will be prepared
  - Disaster planning also helps you:
    - Mitigate risks
	- Think critically about vulnerabilities



## Promote Values of Transparency, Autonomy, and Trustworthiness
- Transparency allows the customers to know what is going on, and decide for themselves their risk tolerance
  - It also creates a more trusting environment with the customers
- Delays may be reasonable in many circumstances
  - Such as waiting for a patch to be rolled out



## Consider Disparate Interests, Resources, and Impacts
- Understand the trade-offs involved
  - Consider encryption: it will help many, including criminals; it will hinder evildoers, but also police
    - An ethical dilemma for sure, with no concrete answer
  - Consider allowing only those paying more to have the better security features
    - Ethically wrong, since you are hurting those with less financial resources



## Invite Diverse Stakeholder Input
- A diverse set of individuals will help generate better ideas
  - [So much research on this one...](https://www.google.com/search?q=diversity+generates+better+ideas)
- A homogeneous group may often have similar ideas
  - Which will hinder "thinking outside the box", which is critical to [the security mindset](security-mindset.html#/)
  - It also hinders seeing things from a wider range of customers



## Design for Privacy and Security
- Design with security and privacy in mind from the beginning
- Don't treat security and privacy as an afterthought!



## Make Ethical Reflection & Practice Standard, Pervasive, Iterative, and Rewarding
- Analyzing one's success and mistakes is critical to learning from the experience
  - This applies to ethical decisions made as well!
  - "Learn" here means both increasing wisdom as well as improving institutional practices
- Don't penalize for this; instead, encourage and reward this type of reflection



## Model and Advocate for Ethical Cybersecurity Practice
- Keep on top of ethics in practice
  - New ethical frameworks, new best practices, new legal guidelines, etc.
- Encourage business relationships with those who are more experienced in these areas
  - Both good to learn from and good to bounce ideas off of
