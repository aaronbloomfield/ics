# History
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Hardware utilization
- During the 1960s and 1970s
- IBM [VM/370 operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VM_(operating_system)
  - Hypervisor (control program) creates virtual machine environment
    - Each user has own virtual machine with guest OS, own address space, virtual devices, etc.
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Decline
- In the 1980s and 1990s, VMs decline in popularity
  - Poor performance
  - Client-server applications
  - Inexpensive PCs
  - Distributed computing
- VMs started as mainframes (one computer for the entire company)
  - Then cheap PCs showed up
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Renewed Interest
- In the late 1990s
- Issues/Challenges
  - Low Infrastructure Utilization
  - Physical infrastructure costs
  - IT management costs
  - Failover/disaster protection
  - High maintenance end-user desktops
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Renewed Interest cont'd
- Issues to resolve...
  - Software compatibility
  - Isolation capability
  - Encapsulation
  - Low overhead/high performance

# Concepts
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Virtual machine types
- Language level
  - Example: Java Virtual Machine
- Process level
  - Example: Wine
- Operating System level
  - Example: Docker, BSD jails
- System level
  - Example: VirtualBox, VMware, Hyper-V
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Terminology
- Host OS: the operating system that booted the computer
- Guest *thing*: what is being run in the virtual machine
  - Here, *thing* could be a process, operating system, etc.
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Language virtual machine
- The Java Virtual Machine is a classic example
  - Compiler translates .java files to bytecode (.class) files
- Any interpreter is really a language virtual machine
  - Python, Ruby, PHP, etc.
- The interpreter / langauge VM can:
  - Handle memory issues (including garbage collection)
  - Do lots of error checking and tracing
  - Still be reasonably fast
	</script></section>

## JVM diagram

From [here](https://www.quora.com/What-is-difference-between-JDK-JRE-and-JVM)
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Process virtual machine
- Allows one to run a single process
- Meant to provied a platform independent environment for a process to run
  - Abstracting away things like the hardware, host OS, etc.
- Wine (Windows emulator for Linux) is an example
  - The binary executes, but Windows system calls are translated into Linux system calls
  - A library (Winelib) fills in for Windows system calls that do not have Linux equivalents
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Process VM examples
- Multiprogramming
  - Each user process given the illusion of having complete machine to itself
    - OS supporting multiple user processes
- Emulators and dynamic binary translators
  - Emulate one instruction set on hardware designed for different instruction set
  - Dynamic binary translation: convert blocks of source instructions to target instructions that perform equivalent functions
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Process VM Examples (cont'd)
- High-level language VMs
  - Cross-platform portability
  - Minimize hardware-specific and OS-specific features
    - Java VM
- So one can argue that a language VM is really a process VM...
  - But we'll differentiate them
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## OS virtual machine
- The host OS shares the same kernel with all the guest OSes
- But each guest OS has its own memory space
  - This separates the different guest OSes from each other and the host OS
- First implementation was FreeBSD jails; Linux's first implementation was LXC
- Most common known example now is Docker
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## OS virtual machine
- FreeBSD jails are a first-class concept in an OS
  - Meaning something the OS directly supports and implements
- Containers are not
  - They are built from other first-class concepts (namespaces, cgroups, etc.)
  - That means you can do more, but there are more bugs and complexity
- See [jfrazelle's blog post](https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/containers-zones-jails-vms/) for more

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## System virtual machine
- Designed to emulate "real" hardwre
- Presents hardware, not drivers, to the guest
  - Whereas the other VMs will present network connections to the guest, a system VM will present an Ethernet device
  - Likewise, not memory allocation calls, but page tables
- These run entire operating systems, and take the most resources
- VirtualBox is the example we all know and love
  - VMWare is popular; Hyper-V is for Windows
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## System VM examples
- Classic system
  - Virtual machine monitor (VMM) on bare hardware
  - IBM VM/370

## System VM examples (cont'd)
- Whole System VMs (Emulation)
  - Complete software system (OS and applications) supported on a host system running a different ISA and OS
    - VirtualPC (Windows on Mac)
- Codesigned VMs (Hardware optimization)
  - No native applications; VM software is part of hardware implementation
    - Transmeta Crusoe
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Terminology confusion
- Some will eliminate OS level, since that's just process level on steroids
- Others will combine language level and process level, since they are both for a single process
  - [Wikipedia VM article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) does this
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Virtualization
- Formally:
  - Virtualization involves the construction of an isomorphism that maps a virtual guest system to a real host. ([Popek and Goldberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popek_and_Goldberg_virtualization_requirements), 1974)
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Virtualization
- Mapping of virtual resources or state to real resources on underlying machine
  - E.g., registers, memory, files
- Emulation of the virtual machine ABI or ISA
  - ABI: Application Binary Interface: how an executable interacts with a library or the OS
  - Use of real machine instructions and/or system calls to carry out actions specified by virtual machine instructions and/or system calls

# VM Operations

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## OS refresher
- User programs run in *user mode*
  - Where a crash (segfault) will kill the process, but not the entire OS
  - Programs are restricted in what they can do
    - They can't directly access hardware; they have to go through the OS
- The OS itself runs in *kernel mode*
  - Where a crash will, in fact, crash the entire OS
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## User mode vs Kernel mode
- Boundary is defined by:
  - System calls
    - Called by user-mode programs, but the function body is completed in kernel mode
  - Device drivers
    - Code written by somebody other than the OS writer, but runs in kernel mode
    - (whether they are in kernel mode fully or not varies by OS)
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## User mode vs Kernel mode
- If a guest OS tries a priviledged operation:
  - The VM forwards to the VMM
    - VMM: Virtual Machine Monitor
  - The VMM handles it by a system call if possible
    - But it's in kernel mode, so it can do it directly
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## VMs and kernel mode
- VMs tend to run the guest OS in user mode
  - But the OSs think they are running on hardware, so they will attempt to do "priviledged" things (like access hardware directly)
- The Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) handles this
  - It is tyipcally a device driver running in kernel mode
- Exceptions from the OS are passed, through the VMM, back to the VM

# Abstraction
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Levels of Abstraction
- Allow implementation details at lower levels of a design to be ignored or simplified
- Arranged in a hierarchy
  - Lower levels - Hardware
    - Physical components with real properties
  -  Higher levels - Software
    - Logical components
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Levels of Abstraction: HW/SW Interface
- High level language (HLL) -> Assembly language
  - Compiler (translation)
- Assembly Language -> Operating System
  - Assembler (translation/mapping to ISA)
- Operating System -> Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
  - Partial Interpretation (device drivers, etc)
- Instruction Set Architecture -> Digital logic
  - Hardware
- Digital logic -> Electronics (transistors, etc.)
  - Hardware
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Levels of Abstraction: Java
- Java (HLL) -> Java Byte Code (ISA)

## Well-defined interfaces: Challenges
- Reduced interoperability
  - Processors support limited instruction sets
    - IA-32 vs. PowerPC
  - Different operating systems
    - Windows vs. Linux
  - Application binaries
    - Dependent on OS and instruction set
- Hardware resource considerations
  - OS

# VMs and Malware
	  </script></section>
	
	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Why do we care about VMs?
- We can run malware within them to 'sandbox' them
  - This allows pausing the execution at various points
- We can simulate other architectures / software systems to study malware
- If we are trying to "break" things, that "breaking" is contained
  - Experimenting with `fork()` for example -- we don't want to fork bomb our host machine
	  </script></section>
	
	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## But are you in a VM?
- Meta-question: [are you living in a computer simulation](https://www.simulation-argument.com/)
  - We'll leave that question for the philosophy classes...
- In Linux, you can install and run `virt-what`, which will determine if you are in a VM or not

## VM Security
- Docker is known to be rather insecure
  - Containers use the same OS, so a kernel bug will exist in both
- There have been "break-outs" of system VMs as well
  - One from March 2017
