# Key Exchange

## Key Exchange
- If you want to communicate with another party, how do you create a private key?
  - One solution: Key stores, but only if you both have generated public/private key sets
    - Not always practical for all security protocols
- One solution: [Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange)
  - This version uses discrete logs
  - A variant called [ECDH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman) uses elliptic curves



## DH key exchange
- Alice and Bob agree on public values *g* (generator) and *p* (prime or modulus)
- Alice picks a private *a* and sends to Bob $A=g^a \mod p$
- Bob picks a private *b* and sends to Alice $B=g^b \mod p$
- Because $g^{ab} \mod p = g^{ba} \mod p$, both can compute the secret key
  - Alice received $g^b \mod p$ and computes $(g^b \mod p)^a \mod p = g^{ab} \mod p$
  - Similarly for Bob

## DH key exchange in practical use
- Used in many cryptographic protocols
  - Including ones we will see shortly
- Uses *very* large numbers created with a very good pseudo-random number generator



## MITM versus DH key exchange?
- Possible if Eve actively controls the communication medium
- If s/he is only a *passive* listener, then it is not possible
- How to avoid an active compromiser:
  - Post on a public forum
  - Use communication methods s/he can't compromise, such as shortwave radio

# Certificates
  </textarea>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n">
  <textarea data-template>
## Definition
- A certificate is:
  - A public key
  - Information about the key (algorithm used, version number, etc.)
  - An identity (hostname, individual, etc.)
  - Other meta-data (expiration date, etc.)
  - A *signature* from a *certificate authority*
- Most common format is [X.509](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509)



## Diagram of an X.509 cert
![x.509 certificate](images/web-security/x.509-cert.svg)



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-800" -->
## Certificate usage
![https certificate](images/web-security/ServerCertificate.png)
- All websites that<br>support https<br>provide such a<br>certificate to<br>any client
- Browsers can<br>display certificate<br>info, such as<br>shown here



## Certificate validity
- All certificates are *signed* with the (private) key of a certificate authority (CA)
  - Their public keys are well known, and are hard-coded into browsers
  - Or determined by key exchange protocols discussed in this slide set
- One can verify such a certificate by the (known) public key of the CA
- One can "self sign" a certificate, but modern browsers typically won't allow viewing without manual exceptions



## Certificate Chains
[![certificate chain](images/web-security/Chain_of_trust.svg)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Chain_of_trust.svg)
An entity (such as virginia.edu) can hold an *intermediate* certificate, which allows it to sign for entities in its division (such as news.virginia.edu)



## Certificate Authorities (CAs)
- Any CA can "vouch" (i.e., sign) for *any* certificate
  - For any website or any (likely new) CA
- Thus, the security is based on the weakest CA
- What happens if a CA is compromised or goes rogue?



## CA Revocation
- This has happened!  In February 2018.
  - [Google to kill Symantec certs in Chrome 66, due in early 2018](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/09/12/chrome_66_to_reject_symantec_certs/)
  - Firefox also: [Distrust of Symantec TLS Certificates](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/03/12/distrust-symantec-tls-certificates/)
- The reason: a site called [Trustico](https://www.trustico.com/) resold Symantec-signed certificates
  - The 23,000 certificates Trustico sold were "compromised"
    - They still had the private keys (a big no-no)
  - They were sold under the umbrella of Symantec, so Symantec was party at fault as well

# SSL & TLS
  </textarea>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n">
  <textarea data-template>
## SSL & TLS
- They are cryptographic protocols used to encrypt network communication
- SSL: Secure Sockets Layer
  - v1.0 never released due to flaws
  - v2.0 released in 1995; broken and not used
  - v3.0 released in 1996; broken and not used
- TLS: Transport Layer Security, the successor to SSL
  - v1.0 released Jan 1999; currently deprecated
  - v1.1 released Apr 2006; currently deprecated
  - v1.2 released Aug 2008; in widespread use
  - v1.3 released Aug 2018; currently being adopted



## TLS Usage
- TLS can be implemented on top of just about any protocol
- Most common use: when implemented on top of HTTP, that yields HTTPS
- Also used for encrypting mail (SMTP)
- A programmer can use it for any other purpose



## Forward Secrecy (FS)
- Also known as perfect forward secrecy (PFS)
- The concept that a compromise of keys...
  - ... including the server's private keys...
- Will *not* allow decryption of past sessions
- Solution: generate a unique *session key* for each encrypted connection
  - And discard once done
- That session key can be communicated via public key cryptography



## Public vs. Symmetric Cryptography
- Public key cryptosystems (such as RSA) are:
  - Very secure: one message will take all the computers in the world longer than the life of the universe to crack
  - Very slow: not feasible for real-time data transmission (downloading a large file, streaming, etc.)
- They are typically used for key exchange, and then symmetric key cryptography is used for the rest of the communication



## TLS 1.2 Handshake, part 1
- Client opens a network connection to server
- Client sends *hello*, including a random number $R_c$ and supported ciphers
- Server responds with *hello*, including a random number $R_s$, selection of which client-supported cipher to use, its certificate, and requests client certificate
- Client checks server certificate, and sends its own cert, and a signature of all previous messages sent
  - Signed with the client certificate's private key
- Server checks client certificate and signature



## TLS 1.2 Handshake, part 2
- Client generates $PMS$ (Pre-Master Secret) -- a session key -- and sends it to server, encrypted with server's public key
- Both sides compute $MS$ (Master Secret) from $PMS$, $R_s$, and $R_c$
- Client send a message to switch over to using the $MS$ for symmetric encryption
  - Server confirms switching over to using the $MS$ for encryption
- Both sides terminate the SSL handshake, and use $MS$ as the symmetric encryption key

## Is TLS 1.2 forward-secret?



## Is TLS 1.2 forward-secret?
- No, it is not (generally)
- Depending on the ciphers used, if the keys are later made available, then it is *NOT* forward-secret
- Let's review the [TLS 1.2 protocol](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/SSL_handshake_with_two_way_authentication_with_certificates.svg)
- What would make it forward-secret?
  - Adding in Diffe-Hellman Key Exchange (DHE)



## TLS 1.3
- Main improvement:
  - Only allow public enryption protocols that are forward-secret (meaning: they use DHE)
- Other imrpovements:
  - Send more of the information as a single message, so there is less back-and-forth to the handshake



## TLS Ciphers Supported
- In version 1.3, for key exchange, only forward-secret public key systems are supported
  - Mostly RSA variants with a secure DH key exchange
  - Version 1.2 allows many other algorithms
- Once the channel is configured, multiple algorithms are supported, the most common being AES

## Message authentication code (MAC)
- It's "a short piece of information used to authenticate a message" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication_code))
- Like a digital signature, but:
  - uses a shared *secret* key, so it is faster
- Like a hash, but:
  - provides authentication, not just a message digest
  - includes the secret key, so two different connections' MAC of the same text will be different due to different secret keys



## A possible MAC
- Given a message $m$ and a secret key $k$:
  - Create a new value $x = m \cdot k$
	- That's string concatenation
  - Hash that message: $h = hash(x)$
	- Use a good hash function!
  - Encrypt that hash with $k$: $mac = encrypt(h,k)$
    - Likely AES (or similar) with the shared secret key
- In one line: $mac = encrypt(hash(m \cdot k),k)$



## MAC properties
- Does not encrypt the message!
  - If the connection is not encrypted, then the message is eavesdroppable
- Cannot be forged without the secret key
  - Any eavesdropper must know the secret key in order to create a valid MAC
- It is "unforgeable under chosen-message attacks"
  - Even if Eve can get Bob to send chosen text attacks, she needs the (unknown to her) secret key to generate a valid MAC
- Provides authentication (since only the other party has the secret key)



## HMAC
- A MAC is a general term for a message authentication code
- A HMAC uses a hash as its algorithm
- Not all MACs use hashes
  - A CMAC uses a cipher (AES, DES, etc.) to create the code
    - Likely truncating it to the first $x$ bits
- The example algorithm a few slides back was an HMAC
- Named by their hash algorithm:
  - HMAC-MD5, HMAC-SHA1, etc.



<table class="transparent"><tr><td style="vertical-align:middle"><h2>HMAC<br>with<br>SHA1</h2></td><td><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:SHAhmac.svg"><img alt="hmac-sha1" src="images/web-security/SHAhmac.svg"></a></td></tr></table>

*i_pad* and *o_pad* have known and non-secret values



## Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD)
- MACs do not *encrypt* the data, and we want to do so
- If we combine encryption and a MAC, we get an AEAD
  - Assuming a few properties about the quality of the encryption and MAC function



## [TLS MAC protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#Key_exchange_or_key_agreement)
![TLS MAC protocols](images/web-security/tls-protocols-3.png)
Note that even if the MAC doesn't support encryption (in the first 3 rows), the cipher (likely AES) still does

# Attacking HTTPS
  </textarea>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n">
  <textarea data-template>
## Attacks on HTTPS
- Most are attacks on TLS in some form
- Like the attacks on RSA, they tend to focus on attacking the *protocol*, and not cracking the encryption
  - Although there are some exceptions...



## Heartbleed (2012)
<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-800" -->
![heartbleed icon](images/web-security/Heartbleed.svg)
- A problem in *one*<br>implementation of<br>the TLS protocol
  - Specifically the<br>OpenSSL library<br>implementation
- Affected about<br>one sixth of<br>all websites



## Heartbleed
- [RFC 6520](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6520) allows a client to send a *Heartbeat Request* message -- like a ping -- to the server
  - It consists of a string and its size (as a 16-bit int)
- The server sends that message back
- In OpenSSL, the library did not check the size of the message
  - So if you sent "bird" and 65,536, it would send 64Kb of data back
    - Which would be a 64Kb dump of the server's memory

## Mining Your Ps and Qs (2012)
- In 2012 it was found that 5% of TLS servers and 9% of SSH servers shared common key material
  - Also, one could compute keys for about 0.5% of TLS hosts (64,000) an 1% of SSH hosts (108,000)
  - Most were headless or embedded devices
- Reference: [Mining Your Ps and Qs: Detection of Widespread Weak Keys in Network Devices](https://factorable.net/weakkeys12.extended.pdf), USENIX '12
- But why?



## Mining Your Ps and Qs
- These devices generated their TLS and/or SSH keys at boot-up
  - Either the first time they were powered on or each time they powered up
- Recall that for RSA, $n = p*q$
- The pseudo-random number generator (PRG) on Linux is of very low quality at boot-up
  - It takes about a minute after boot-up to create good quality keys

## Apple Goto Fail (Feb 2014)
- A stray `goto` statement kept the Apple libraries from properly checking certificates for almost a year

<pre class="codesmall"><code>hashOut.data = hashes + SSL_MD5_DIGEST_LEN;
hashOut.length = SSL_SHA1_DIGEST_LEN;
if ((err = SSLFreeBuffer(&hashCtx)) != 0)
    goto fail;
if ((err = ReadyHash(&SSLHashSHA1, &hashCtx)) != 0)
    goto fail;
if ((err = SSLHashSHA1.update(&hashCtx, &clientRandom)) != 0)
    goto fail;
if ((err = SSLHashSHA1.update(&hashCtx, &serverRandom)) != 0)
    goto fail;
if ((err = SSLHashSHA1.update(&hashCtx, &signedParams)) != 0)
    goto fail;
    goto fail;  /* MISTAKE! THIS LINE SHOULD NOT BE HERE */
if ((err = SSLHashSHA1.final(&hashCtx, &hashOut)) != 0)
    goto fail;

err = sslRawVerify(...)
</code></pre>



## Null Prefix Attack (2009)
- String types
  - C strings end in a NUL byte ('\0')
  - Pascal style strings have the length at the beginning
    - NUL characters are valid in these strings
- X.509 certificates use Pascal-style strings
- Consider obtaining a certificate for:
  ```
gmail.com\0.mydomain.com
```
- The CA sees some sub-domain off of mydomain.com
- Browsers see a certificate for gmail.com



## More attacks
- Wikipedia [lists a dozen or so](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#Attacks_against_TLS/SSL)

## How are you tracked online?
- Can you list the ways?
- I listed 10 different ways...



## 1. "Standard" cookies
- All web connections are, by definition, stateless
- A cookie allows one to "save" state
  - Remember who you are, for example
- So when you return to amazon.com, it knows who you are
- Most sites that log you in use cookies of some sort
  - Some use server variables, such as UVa's netbadge



## Cookie exchange
[![web cookie](images/web-security/800px-HTTP_cookie_exchange.svg.png)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:HTTP_cookie_exchange.svg)



## What a cookie stores
<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-800" -->
[![http cookie](images/web-security/HTTP-Cookie-Google.svg)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:HTTP-Cookie-Google.svg)
- The URL the cookie<br>applies to (domain<br>and path)
- An information string
- An expiration date

Modern browsers limit cookie viewing to the domain (or URL) that issued the cookie



## 2. Cross-domain content
- Website A can include an image (or script, or CSS file) from website B
  - Now both A and B can leave cookies
  - This request includes the referring website!  So B can see where you have been
- Part of the headers of any [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) page:
  ```
<script
src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/.../jquery.min.js">
</script>
```
- So Google now knows what sites you've visited



<!-- .slide: class="max-pre-400" -->
## An example close to home...
- A recent [cavalier daily article](http://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2018/10/early-voting-numbers-show-sharp-increase-from-last-off-year-midterm-elections) loaded 347 (sic) different pieces of content from 52 different domains (33 unique TLDs)

## 3. "Tracking" cookies
- A cookie from a known domain that attempts to track you across multiple sites
  - The difference is that it is known that this particular domain does lots of tracking
  - It is ultimately no different than a regular cookie
- Considered spyware, they are flagged (and removed) by modern anti-virus scanners



## 4. Social media comment boxes
- Those tiny little icons to encourage you to share that page on social media: <img alt="social media comments" src="images/web-security/social-media-comments.png" style="width:600px">
- It's actually an [iframe](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_iframe.asp) with FB content, and obviously includes the referrer
- Now Facebook knows what articles you read
- Many social media widgets are similar



## 5. Javascript tracking code
- Javascript is basically somebody else's code running in your (sandboxed) browser
- One can easily include code to track users, such as via [Google analytics](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/)
- Google Analytics is included from http://www.virginia.edu (along with a twitter widget)



## 6. Non-digital purchases
- Brick-and-mortar retailers have gotten in on the tracking game also:
  - Grocery store "loyalty cards"
  - Coupons, such as Bed Bath & Beyond's 20% off coupons
    - They connect it to you even if you pay cash!



## 7. Canvas elements
- The [canvas element](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp) allows graphic-based mark-up, rendering of fonts, etc.
  - The element can be hidden
- So create a hidden canvas element, and render some text
  - Each browser / OS / set of fonts will render this slightly differently
- This creates a partial *signature* to help identify you
  - We'll see one in a bit...
- There are canvas blocker extensions available for every major browser



## 8. Browser fingerprint
- When you visit a website, your browser sends information about your host system
  - OS (including version), browser (including version), etc.
- Combine that with a few other things, such as canvas-rendered text ...
- ... and you get a possibly unique signature of you



## More on browser fingerprints
- These can be used to track you even *after* you have cleared your cookies
  - And they can link you to previous visits
- Is yours unique?  Check out https://amiunique.org
  - It shows a canvas-based text rendering



## 9. Financial payments
- If you use PayPal, then it knows a lot about what you buy
  - Likewise amazon pay, venmo, etc.
- These sites have differing levels of privacy statements



## 10. Geo-location
- For a device without a GPS, this is easy, but rough
  - Go to https://www.iplocation.net/; they were within 2.2 miles for me
- For any mobile device with a GPS, this is trivial
  - And *very* precise -- which store you just visited, whose house you are at, etc.
  - And, likely, who else is there with you
- Google continues to track your mobile device even after you have signed out or opted out ([reference](https://www.pcmag.com/news/363068/report-google-tracks-location-data-even-if-youve-opted-out))
