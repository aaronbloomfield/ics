## What is a cryptocurrency?
- A digital asset designed to work as a [medium of exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_of_exchange)
  - "a widely accepted token which can be exchanged for goods and services"
  - What all modern currencies are (or are intended to be)
- They use modern cryptographic technologies (encryption and hashing), hence the name



## What is a cryptocurrency?
According to Jan Lansky ([source](http://si-journal.org/index.php/JSI/article/viewFile/335/325)) it has the following six properties:
1. No central authority, and its state is maintained through distributed consensus
2. The system keeps an overview of cryptocurrency units and their ownership
3. The system defines whether new cryptocurrency units can be created and how
4. Ownership of cryptocurrency units can be proved exclusively cryptographically



## What is a cryptocurrency?
According to Jan Lansky ([source](http://si-journal.org/index.php/JSI/article/viewFile/335/325)) it has the following six properties:
<ol start="5"><li>The system allows for transactions (transfers), which can only occur from the entity that can prove ownership of the source currency</li>
<li>If two different instructions for changing the ownership of the same cryptographic units are simultaneously entered, the system performs at most one of them</li></ol>



## Consider the AaronDollar (TM)
<!-- .slide: class="no-white-img-background max-image-height-300" -->
![AaronDollar (TM)](images/cryptocurrency/aaron-dollar.png)
- Would you pay me 1 dollar for it?  What about 10?  100?
<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">If I told you it would buy you an A+ in the course...<ul><li>Would you pay me 1 dollar for it?  What about 10?  100?</li></ul></li>



## What makes money worth anything?
- A currency has value if people *believe* that it has value based on:
  - It being widely accepted
  - It being backed by a stable government or entity
  - It having a reasonable inflation rate
  - It being exchangeable for something else of value



## Currency examples
- Some examples:
  - The US Dollar is the most widely used in international financial transactions
  - Due to the [crisis Venezuela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_in_Venezuela), the Venezuelan [bolivar soberano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_bol%C3%ADvar) (VEB), and its predecessor the bolivar fuerte, are essentially worthless
    - The VEB had a 1,698,488% (yes, 1.7 *million* percent) inflation rate in 2018
<!-- change each semester -->



## What makes a digital currency worth anything?
- This means currencies for which there is no non-digital equivalent
- It is worth something if:
  - It is widely accepted
  - Entities are willing to exchange it for goods or other currencies
  - It can be exchanged for something else



## Cryptocurrencies
- There are 10,861 currently, as per [investing.com](https://www.investing.com/crypto/currencies) (as of June 2022)
<!-- change each semester -->
- Some are [Ponzi schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme), some are [pyramid schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme), and some are worthwhile
- Their value comes in if they are widely accepted, and very few are
  - You can see a [list of the 10 with the highest market cap](https://coinmarketcap.com)
- Bitcoin was the first, the most widely accepted, and the most stable, so it will be focused on in this slide set

## A note about numbers...
- The data in this slide set was all updated for the current semester (on June 5, 2022)
- Bitcoin is highly volatile (the value changes so fast) that it is likely to be quite different in a day or two
  - Indeed, the value of a Bitcoin changed *during* the updating of the numbers!
    - So you will see (slightly) different values for the price, for example
- Also, most of the graphs are from the previous day's market close



## History
- The first viable cryptocurrency, it was created in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto
  - That's a pseudonym; nobody knows who the real person (or group) that created it
  - Although the person is [likely British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto#Characteristics_and_identity)
- It is now fully open source
- It was also one of the first digital-only currencies that didn't bankrupt the creator...



## Bitcoin price from [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com)
BTC peaked at $68,789 in November 2021 ([source](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/market-price?timespan=all))
![BTC price](images/cryptocurrency/btc-price-2022-06-05.webp)
<!-- change each semester -->



## Peer to peer
- Bitcoin is completely peer to peer
  - No central authority!
- When a decision has to be made...
  - ... such as which mined block to accept (more on that later)...
  - ... the nodes vote on the choice
- This means little regulation, but also lots of privacy



## Wallet
- You create a bitcoin *wallet*, which is a public/private key set
  - Many software programs can create this for you
  - With such rampant Bitcoin theft, hardware wallets are much more secure
- Transfers are between the public keys of the wallets, but require signing by the private key
  - If you lose your private key (or forget the password it's encrypted with), there is no way to get your Bitcoin back



## Anonymity and usage
- Bitcoin allows for (mostly) anonymous transactions
  - You only publish your wallet's public key
- Thus, it's also used for illegal things:
  - Tax evasion
  - Purchasing of illegal items
  - Transfers of money without oversight



## Transactions
- You state you want to transfer *x* from yourself (*S*) to a destination (*D*)
  - *S* and *D* are the public keys of the wallets
  - You also include the hash of the transaction(s) where you got the money
- You sign all this with your wallet's private key
  - You then broadcast this to the P2P network
- This takes *10 minutes* for the transaction to occur
  - This prevents [double spending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending)
  - And this is partly for mining reasons we will see shortly



## The mempool
- All transactions are stored in a *mempool* (memory pool), which is public
  - Maintained by a network of "equally privileged miners"
- Every 10 minutes or so, all the transactions are combined into a single *block*
  - That block eventually becomes part of the *blockchain* (through mining)



## Blockchain
- The first block was the "genesis block"
- Each successive block includes the SHA-256 hash of the previous block
  - Thus, you can't make a change to a previous block without changing all future blocks
- The current blockchain (as of June 2022) is  739,442 blocks ([source](https://bitinfocharts.com/)) and about 409 Gb in size ([source](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/blocks-size))

# Mining
  </textarea>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n">
  <textarea data-template>
## Mining
- Mining is just a record keeping operation
  - It is what creates the blocks of blockchain
- A block consists of:
  - A listing of the transactions over the last 10 (or so) minutes
  - The SHA-256 hash of the *previous* block in the chain
  - A *nonce* (described later), which is just a number
- The process is intentionally computationally intensive, and generates BTC as a reward



## Target
- The [target](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Target) is the 256-bit number that a blockchain SHA-256 hash must be below
- Goal: generate a [nonce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce) (a one-time numerical value) to add to the block that will cause the SHA-256 hash to be below the target
  - Similar to what you did in the CRC part of the [hashing homework](../hws/hw-hashing.html)



## First target
- The first target was defined as: 00000000ffff00000000000000000000 00000000000000000000000000000000
  - (that's 8 hex 0's, 4 hex f's, then 52 hex 0's)
  - To properly mine a block, your nonce must create a SHA-256 hash below that value
  - With 8 leading hex 0's, the chance of a random nonce working is $(1/16)^8 = 1/(2^4)^8=1/2^{32}$
  - Or 1 in about 4.3 billion



## Difficulty
- First target ($ft$): 00000000ffff00000000000000 00000000000000000000000000000000000000
- The current target ($ct$) is 000000000000000000096a2000000000 00000000000000000000000000000000
  - As of June 2022 and can be found [here](http://learnmeabitcoin.com/glossary/target)
  <!-- change each semester -->
  - The new target is harder than the old: specifically $ft/ct$ = 29,897,409,688,833 times harder (that's about 30 *trillion*)
- This number is the bitcoin *difficulty*, and the latest value can be found [here](https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitcoin/difficulty-chart)



## Current hash difficulty
- For the first target, a random nonce had a 1 in 4.3 billion chance of success
- The current target is about 30 trillion times harder
  <!-- change each semester -->
  - A random nonce now has a 1 in $7.6 \times 10^{22}$ chance of success <!-- formula in bc (ibase & obase = 10): 2^(256-log2(ct)) -->



## How long this will take
- A typical CPU can do maybe 10 Mhash/sec (million hashes per second)
  - A very fast CPU today could do about 25 Mhash/sec
  - A [$900 video card](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GHXQTGZ/) today could do about 800 Mhash/sec (estimate based on [this](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Non-specialized_hardware_comparison#Nvidia) and [this](https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Nvidia-RTX-2080-vs-Nvidia-GeForce-GTX-590-SLI-Disabled/4026vsm8041))
- Consider a 1 in $7.6 \times 10^{22}$ chance of success
- To generate $7.6 \times 10^{22}$ hashes at 800 million (8 Mhash) per second on a fast graphics card, this will take about 3 *million years*
  <!-- change each semester -->



## Electricity usage
- A graphics card uses about 200 W (watts) (estimated from [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Non-specialized_hardware_comparison#Nvidia))
- Electricity in Charlottesville costs 11.04 cents per kW/h (as per [here](https://www.electricitylocal.com/states/virginia/charlottesville/))
- So 2.2 million years is $1.2*10^{11}$ hours
  <!-- change each semester -->
- Which will cost 5.7 *billion* dollars
- With 1 BTC going for about `$`30k, your reward is less than `$`200k



## Why so hard?
- Mining generates a reward so that:
  - People are encouraged to mine, which will allow for proper record keeping
  - The system can add BTC over time as more transactions occur
    - Adding money into an economy is something that countries do, and (when done responsibly) is good financial policy
- Because of the reward, mining is intentionally difficult to do



## Why so hard?
- The mining difficulty is set so that the time to compute one block will take approximately 10 minutes
  - The more computational resources that are devoted to mining, the harder the difficulty will be
- The difficulty is recomputed every 2016 blocks
  - If a block takes exactly 10 minutes, that's every 2 weeks
- The difficulty is adjusted to meet the 10 minute per block target



## All-time difficulty graph from [blockchain.com](https://www.blockchain.com/en/charts/difficulty)

![BTC difficulty, last 3 years](images/cryptocurrency/btc-difficulty-last-3-years-2022-06-05.webp)
<!-- change each semester -->



## Reward per block
- The reward for computing a block was 50 BTC in block #1
  - It halves every 210,000 blocks
  - At about 10 minutes per block, that's about every 4 years before it halves
- This is the creation of new BTC, and how currency is added
  - As the reward becomes smaller, transaction fees will kick in to help



## Reward per block
- The current reward (as of June 2022) is 6.25 BTC
  <!-- change each semester -->
  - The estimated date when it drops to 6.25 is May 2024 ([source](https://www.bitcoinblockhalf.com/))
- At a price of about `$`30k per BTC ([source](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin)), that's about `$`187,500 for a properly signed block!
  - But if it costs $5.7 billion in electricity, perhaps it's not all that worth it
  - Unless you use somebody else's electricity...



## Current state of mining
- Needless to say, CPUs and graphics cards are no longer viable to use for mining
  - Special purpose hardware can be found online
- Many people use company resources for the mining
- Others use botnets
- Javascript mining programs are found on many web pages, and run in *your* browser
  - Thus, they are using *your* electricity for their financial gain



## Pooled mining
- If it would take your high-end GPU a million years to compute a block, and blocks need to be computed every 10 minutes, then you aren't going to get very far on your own
- *Mining pools* aggregate many resources, and distribute any rewards based on the computational resources provided to the pool



## Hashes per second from [blockchain.com](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate)
For the entire Bitcoin network; E = exa = $10^{18}$
<!-- change each semester -->
![hashes per second](images/cryptocurrency/btc-hashes-per-sec-2022-06-05.webp)



## Mining hardware
- A whole industry has sprung up: you can find the hardware online (such as [here](https://www.bitcoinmining.com/bitcoin-mining-hardware/))
- These devices are much faster and use much less electricity
- Consider the [DragonX AntMinder S9](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WV6TPN7), which costs $599
  <!-- change each semester -->
  - It can compute 14 Thash/sec (tera), or $14*10^{12}$ hash/sec
  - I don't believe their numbers that they post at that link, though



## Mining profitability
- A reasonable profit margin estimate:
  - For a investment of $x$ dollars in mining equipment, you might make one-tenth of that per month
  - So you will start to make a profit in almost a year, assuming that the difficulty doesn't go up that much
- Keep in mind that if this were *really* profitable, then everybody would jump in on it, and the difficulty would just jump up, causing it to become suddenly less profitable



## [DragonX AntMinder S9](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WV6TPN7) analysis
<!-- change each semester -->
- We know that:
  - The current hash rate is 212.5 EH/s
  - Blocks take about 10 minutes to process (actually about 8m 47s right now ([source](https://bitinfocharts.com/)))
  - The [DragonX AntMinder S9](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WV6TPN7) claims to hash 14 TH/s
- 212.5 exa / 14 tera = $212.5 \cdot 10^{18} / 14 \cdot 10^{12} = 1.5 \cdot 10^{7}$ or 15.2 million
- Thus, you would expect to get one 15-millionth of a block's reward in a pooled setup
- At $187,500 per block, that's 1.25 *cents* per block
- (And we aren't counting electricity here)



## [DragonX AntMinder S9](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WV6TPN7) analysis
<!-- change each semester -->
- At $187,500 per block, that's 1.25 *cents* per block
  - Which is $1.80 per day
    - This assumes 10 minute blocks; it's maybe $2 with more frequent blocks
  - You will make back your initial investment of $600 in 300 days (10 months)
- This assumes that the numbers don't change!
  - And we know the reward per block will go down in May of 2024...
- There is also [one available](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YVMS7CY/) that mines 3 times as fast but costs twice as much



## Should you mine bitcoin?
No.
