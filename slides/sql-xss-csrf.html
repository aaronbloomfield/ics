# SQL Primer
	  </textarea></section>
	  
	  <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n$"><textarea data-template>
## SQL Primer
- SQL - Structured Query Language - is a formally defined language
  - ANSI formalized first in 1986
  - Latest version is SQL:2016
- There are many companies and products that create a database that uses SQL
  - Microsoft Access, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.
- The level of SQL we will be studying will apply to all of these


## SQL Basics
- SQL data is stored in tables, similar to spreadsheets like excel
- Each row is an entry, and each column has a type
- This table on the next slide has types: string, string, string, integer


## SQL Table
| Last name | First name | Userid | Year |
|-----------|------------|--------|------|
| Smith | Isabella | ias1s | 1 |
| Johnson | Jacob | jbj2t | 2 |
| Williams | Emma | ecw3u | 3 |
| Jones | Ethan | edj4v | 4 |
| Brown | Olivia | oeb5w | 1 |
| Davis | Michael | mfd6x | 2 |
| Miller | Sophia | sgm7y | 3 |
| Wilson | William | whw8z | 4 |


## SQL commands: select
- You can retrieve all the table's data:
```
select * from course;
```
- You can select only specific data:
```
select * from course where year=2;
select * from course where substring (userid,1,1)='e';
```


## SQL select command output
- The output is in the format of a text-based table:

```
mysql> select * from course where
       substring(userid,1,1)='e';
+----------+-------+--------+------+
| lname    | fname | userid | year |
+----------+-------+--------+------+
| Williams | Emma  | ecw3u  |    3 |
| Jones    | Ethan | edj4v  |    4 |
+----------+-------+--------+------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql>
```


## SQL commands: update
- To change a single entry:
```
update course set year=5 where userid='edj4v';
```
- To update all entries
```
update course set year=5;
```


## SQL commands: insert
- To create a new entry:
```
insert into course set lname='Moore', fname='Ava',
       userid='aim9r', year=5;
```
- An alternate form:
```
insert into course values ('Moore', 'Ava', 'aim9r', 5);
```


## SQL commands: delete
- To delete a single entry:
```
delete from course where userid='ias1s';
```
- To delete many entries:
```
delete from course where year=1;
```
- To delete all entries
```
delete from course;
```


## Other SQL commands
- `show databases;`
  - Shows which databases exist that the user can access
- `use <db>;`
  - Changes to a different database
- `show tables;`
  - Shows which tables are in the current DB
- `describe <table>;`
  - Gives details about the table columns


## Other SQL commands
- `drop database <db>;`
  - Deletes an entire database (and all the tables in that DB)
- `create table <table> [...];`
  - Creates a table
- `create database <db>;`
  - Creates a database, which can hold an arbitrary number of tables
- `grant [...];`
  - Sets ('grants') permissions on a database to a given user


## Other SQL commands
- `truncate <table>;`
  - Erases all the data in the table
  - Almost the same as 'delete from course;'
- `drop table <table>;`
  - Deletes an entire table (and all data!)


## Comments
- Anything starting with "-- " will be a comment
  - There are *three* characters there (two dashes and a space)
- Similar to C++'s `//`, it is a comment until the end of the line

# SQL Injection Attacks
	  </textarea></section>
	  
	  <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n$"><textarea data-template>
## Vulnerable script for SQL injections
- Let's imagine that your web script asks for your userid
  - Then does a select command on that value
- Pseudo-code:
```
var userid = getUseridFromWebForm()
var query = "select * from course where userid='" +
              userid + "';"
var result = databaseQuery (query)
doSomethingWithTheResult (result)
```
- This has a SQL injection attack vulnerability
  - Next, we'll see an exploit


## Normal operation
- If we enter 'asb2t' into the web form, we will get the following SQL command:
<pre class="code">
select * from course where userid='<span class='hotpink'>asb2t</span>';
</pre>
- Which works as desired


## SQL injection attack exploit
- What if we enter the following as our userid:
``` 
'; truncate course; -- 
``` 
- At that point, our SQL command is as follows:
<pre class="code">
select * from course where userid='<span class='hotpink'>'; truncate course; -- </span>';
</pre>
- Which does not work as desired


## SQL injection attack exploit
- Our SQL injection attack query:
<pre class="code">
select * from course where
    userid='<span class='hotpink'>'; truncate course; -- </span>';
</pre>
- The DB will perform two database operations (a select then a delete), and then see a comment at the end of the statement
  - The DB function the script calls might return a value or it might not
- At this point, we have deleted everything from the table


## SQL injection attack exploit
- This is not stealthy - the DB probably won't work right if everything has been deleted
- We can put in various commands to modify the database, or access data from it that we would not be able to access otherwise
- Typically, the privileges that a script runs allow full read/write access to the entire database
- We can obviously put more nefarious commands in the injection attack as well
  - drop table, drop database, etc.


## SQL injection attack prevention
- How to prevent against this?
  - We need to *escape* our input string
- If our input is the same:
```
'; truncate course; -- 
```
- An escaped input string would result in:
```
select * from course where 
		userid='\'; truncate course;';
```
- This will search for an odd username, but it will not allow an injection attack


## SQL injection attack prevention
- Some (modern) web scripting languages do this automatically
  - In PHP, any input string is automatically escaped
  - You need to call `stripslashes()` to remove them
- Not all languages do this, though
  - Perl, C/C++, Java, etc.
  - But many provide functions, such as addslashes(), to do this very easily (but not automatically!)


## SQL escaped strings
- There are *four* characters that need to be escaped for safe string handling:
  - Single quote (as it can start/end strings)
  - Double quote (as it can start/end strings)
  - Backslash (as it can change the meaning of the next character)
  - NUL byte (as it can signify the end of a string)
- Other languages may have additional character(s) that need escaping


## Better SQL attack prevention
- Escaping strings will prevent the attacks, but not much else
  - It's error-prone, because it is easy to forget to do this
- Proper prevention means validating the input
  - Checking that it is a proper userid
	- Check it against a regex for userids!
  - If not, then trigger an error response
  - And log and notify that error response!!!

# HTML and Javascript Primer
	  </textarea></section>
	  
	  <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n$"><textarea data-template>
## A very basic web page
```
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Basic page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello world!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```


## A very basic web page 
```html
<!doctype html>
```
Specifies the HTML document version
```html
<html>
```
Beginning of the HTML text
```html
  <head>
```
Beginning of the head section (contains document info, but
not the document content itself)
```html
    <title>Basic page</title>
```
The title of the document


## A very basic web page 
```html
  </head>
```
End of the head section
```html
  <body>
```
Beginning of the body section (contains the actual document text)
```html
    <p>Hello world!</p>
```
The (one line of) document text in paragraph tags


## A very basic web page 
```html
  </body>
```
End of the body section
```html
  </html>
```
End of the HTML text


## Javascript in web pages
- Javascript (no relation to Java) has C-like syntax, and is used for rich client-side functionality
- To put a Javascript program in your web page:
```
<script>
/* your Javascript program here */
</script>
```
- Or:
```
<script src="path/to/script.js">
```


## Long URLs
- You can embed form data into a URL:
  - http://www.google.com/search?q=aaron+bloomfield 
  - This is quite common, and is often desired functionality
  - (this is actually GET data, not POST data, but we'll ignore the difference here)


## HTML comments
- Any block that starts with `<!--` and ends with `-->` is a comment
```
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- written by Jane Doe -->
   <title>Home page</title>
...
```


## Forms
We've all seen HTML forms:
```html
 <form action="/action_page.php">
  First name: <input type="text" name="firstname"><br>
  Last name: <input type="text" name="lastname"><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form> 
```
- Allows one to request multiple data elements from the client


## $<$form$>$ tag
- Attributes:
  - `action="/action_page.php"`: specifies the script to receive the form data
  - `method="post"`: how the data is sent
    - GET means it's a long URL: http://server.com/foo.php?username=abcd&password=123
	  - There are limits to the data size sent
	  - And lots of security issues for sensitive data
	- POST means it's sent, but not in the URL
  - `enctype="multipart/form-data"`: if you are uploading files or attachments


## HTML Form Widgets
Lots of different ones (image from [OpenTechSchool](http://opentechschool.github.io/python-flask/core/forms.html)):
![input types](images/sql-xss-csrf/sample_web_form.png)

There are also *hidden* input fields:
```html
<input type="hidden" name="school" value="uva">
```

# Cross-site scripting (XSS)
	  </textarea></section>
	  
	  <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n$"><textarea data-template>
## Background: same origin policy
- Web browsers only allow one script to access data from another script if the scripts:
  - Are on the same domain
  - Use the same protocol
  - Use the same port
- This prevents a malicious script from accessing the data from another script


## XSS Vulnerable Scripts
- Let's envision a very simple web script
  - It asks you for your name in a web form text field in a web form
  - It takes that name, and displays a page that just says "hello, name!"
- While this is an (intentionally) very simple situation to show how XSS works, much more complicated ones exist
  - Ebay, where you enter your search string
  - Financial institutions, where you also enter a search string


## The 'basic' web page, updated
```
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Basic web page</title>
<script>
var balance=1;
</script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello Aaron!</p> <!-- name from user input -->
    <p>Your account balance is 
<!-- newly added code follows -->
<script>
document.write(balance);
</script>
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```
Output: Hello, Aaron!  Your account balance is 1


## Using long URLs
- Perhaps the previous page can be obtained via:
```
http://www.nowhere.abc/printinfo.php?name=Aaron
```
- (not a real site, of course - notice the TLD is wrong)


## Exploiting the XSS vulnerability
- Instead of our name of 'Aaron', we will input the following as our name:
```
<script>\nbalance=1000000;\n</script>Aaron
```
- Note the necessary returns in the text (`\n`), which can also be represented as '%0a'
- Some browsers will work with the "\n" part removed entirely


## The HTML page afterward
```
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Basic web page</title>
<script>
var balance=1;
</script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello <script>
balance=1000000;
</script>Aaron!</p>
    <p>Your account balance is 
<script>
document.write(balance);
</script>
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```
Output: Hello Aaron! Your account balance is 1000000


## More complicated XSS attacks
- If a decision is based upon said balance, then the decision point can be changed
  - Not likely that such a decision will be decided client-side
- Perhaps you can inject code to view cookies or session variables
  - But these are easily discernible through the browser anyway
- So we need a reason do perform such an exploit...


## Long URLs
- Assume the page we developed can be obtained via:
  - http://www.nowhere.abc/printinfo.php?name=Aaron 
- Then why can't we do the following?
  - `http://www.nowhere.abc/printinfo.php?name=<script>\nbalance=1000000;\n</script>Aaron`
- That has some non-standard characters (spaces, quotes, returns), but we can fix those


## An XSS attack in a long URL
- We replace the punctuation with their web encodings:
  - \n with %0a
  - space with %20
  - ! with %21
  - \- with %2d
  - / with %2f
  - etc.
- Some are definitely necessary, others are just in case they are necessary


## An XSS attack in a long URL
- Our new (and rather long) URL:
  - http://www.nowhere.abc/printinfo.php?name=%3cscript%3e%0abalance%3d1000000%3b%0a%3c%2fscript%3eAaron   
- This contains an XSS attack in a URL!


## How to create an XSS exploit
- Download the HTML page, and save it locally
- Enter the script manually, and make sure it works
- *Then*, encode the script using URL-encoded text
  - There are online utilities to do this, such as the one at https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/
- Pass that to the script
- Note that trying to edit the Javascript code through the URL-encoded text won't work!


## XSS exploit payloads
- An XSS exploit can be a URL link that somebody clicks on (perhaps via e-mail) that goes to bankofamerica.com, and...
  - Reads the account number and/or balance into Javascript variable(s)
  - Sends that data to a remote server
    - This can be done via XMLHttpRequest(), which is the function used for Web 2.0 functionality
- Alternately, it can be used to steal cookies, which can allow an attacker to impersonate a victim


## An XSS attack scenario
- Alice often visits Bob's website, where sensitive information is stored.
- Mallory observes that Bob's website contains a reflected XSS vulnerability.
- Mallory crafts an exploit URL, sends to Alice, and entices her to click on it
  - This URL is for Bob's website, but contains Mallory's malicious code, which the website will reflect (execute).
  - Alice visits the URL provided by Mallory while logged into Bob's website.


## An XSS attack scenario
- The malicious script embedded in the URL executes in Alice's browser, as if it came directly from Bob's server
  - This is the actual XSS vulnerability.
  - The script can be used to send Alice's session cookie to Mallory.
- Mallory can then use the session cookie to steal sensitive information available to Alice (authentication credentials, billing info, etc.) without Alice's knowledge.
- [Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting#Non-persistent)


## Defenses
- Treat data as data, and escape it!
  - Use web frameworks or modern PLs that do this for you
- There are many minute details to get right; see [here][1] for details

# Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
	  </textarea></section>
	  
	  <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n$"><textarea data-template>
## CSRF
- Take a site you are logged into (facebook, bank, etc.)
- Imagine a malicious form posting (or GET request) that is hidden in another link that you "accidentally" click
  - That form posting has you do something malicious: transfer money, upload file, like a comment, post to your wall, etc.
- How does the site know that the form posting came from itself and not a malicious link that was "accidentally" clicked on?


## CSRF example
- An example link: https://site.com/post.php?title=abcd&content=Lorem.ipsum
- One can imagine a form as well (that is not on site.com):
```
 <form action="https://site.com/post.php" method="post">
  <input type="hidden" name="title" value="abcd">
  <input type="hidden" name="content" 
         value="Lorem.ipsum">
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form> 
```
  - This form will only show a submit button, which can be disguised via CSS to look like *anything*


## The need for CSRF
- We need to be able to prevent another site from forging a form posting request
- Solution: we'll add a *token* to the form, and check it upon submission
  - That token is sent over the HTTPS (i.e., TLS encrypted) connection, so any eavesdropper won't be able to see it


## HTML form with a CSRF token

This is based on the form from the [HTML and Javascript primer](#/htmljs) section:
```html
 <form action="/action_page.php">
  First name: <input type="text" name="firstname"><br>
  Last name: <input type="text" name="lastname"><br>
  <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" 
         value="5AEF1xArSLLcoQQJrNkuaRs9tsSb8C8aFm">
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form> 
```


## CSRF Requirements
- The server needs to keep track of *which* token it sent and to *who*
  - The *who* is likely an (authenticated) user at a given IP address
  - Or maybe based on cookie (which may be tied to an IP address)
- Modern web frameworks do this for you
  - The csrf token from the previous slide was based on what Django provides
