## Vulnerability vs exploit
- A *vulnerability* is a weakness (or bug) in the security of a program
  - A lock that is easy to pick
- An *exploit* is an attack that makes use of some vulnerability
  - A "skeleton key" that can open many types of locks



## Authentication vs authorization
- *Authentication* is determining who a user is
  - Signing in through netbadge, for example
- *Authorization* is controlling one's actions based on who they are
  - Normal users can not delete certain things, for example



## Vector vs payload
- The malware's *vector* is the means by which it attacked the host
  - Virus, buffer overflow, worm, back door, etc.
- The malware's *payload* is what damage or effects it causes
  - File deletion, infection of other files, mailing spam, etc.
  - Malware may not have a payload



## Hack
From [dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/hack?s=t):

> hack (intransitive verb): to modify (a computer program or electronic device) or write (a program) in a skillful or clever way

> hack (intransitive verb): to circumvent security and break into (a network, computer, file, etc.), usually with malicious intent



## Hacker
From [dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/hack?s=t):

> hacker (noun): a person who has a high level of skill in computer technology or programming; a computer expert or enthusiast

> hacker (noun): a person who circumvents security and breaks into a network, computer, file, etc., usually with malicious intent



## 'Hack' and 'hacker' in context
- Good contexts:
  - We have all heard of (or participated in) hack-a-thons
  - One may hack a program together
  - "That's a great hack"
- Bad contexts:
  - Any malware is termed to be created by 'hackers'
  - One who hacks into a secure system to do something malicious

# Malware Types
  </textarea></section>

  <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n"><textarea>
## Characteristics of malware
- Self-replicating: does it reproduce by itself?
- Population growth: how does the infected population increase?
  - Zero if it is not self-replicating
  - But self replicating can have either a zero or positive population growth
- Parasitic: does it need another executable in order to exist?



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-400" -->
## Logic bomb
![logic bomb](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Bomb_icon.svg/350px-Bomb_icon.svg.png)
- Self-replicating: 	no
- Population growth: 	zero
- Parasitic: 		possibly
&nbsp;  

<p class="blankline">&nbsp;</p>

- Has a *payload*, which is an action to perform
  - Delete files, etc. -- usually a malicious effect
- Has a *trigger*, which is a Boolean condition as to when to execute
  - On a given date, when somebody performs some action, etc.



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-nb-400" -->
## Trojan Horse
![Trojan rabbit](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/98/31/91/983191ca276eb1227fd2f85960215b8c.jpg)
- Self-replicating:	no 
- Population growth: 	zero
- Parasitic: 		yes
&nbsp;  

<p class="blankline">&nbsp;</p>

- A program that looks like a valid program, but has a malicious purpose
  - Stealing passwords, deleting files, etc.



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-nb-300" -->
## Back door
![back door](http://img11.deviantart.net/8549/i/2012/129/b/b/door_ajar_by_layall-d4z3odw.jpg)
- Self-replicating:	no 
- Population growth: 	zero
- Parasitic: 		possibly
&nbsp;  

<p class="blankline">&nbsp;</p>

- Any mechanism that allows bypassing of the normal security checks
  - If you are logging in from this IP address, or enter a specific username, don't ask for a password



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-nb-300" -->
## Virus
![virus](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Coronavirus._SARS-CoV-2.png/768px-Coronavirus._SARS-CoV-2.png)
- Self-replicating:		yes 
- Population growth: 	positive
- Parasitic: 			yes
&nbsp;  

<p class="blankline">&nbsp;</p>

- Code that *modifies* an executable program file and inserts itself into it
  - This self-replication into existing executable code is the defining characteristic of a virus
- Often has a destructive payload
- Does not *propagate* using a network, but infected files can be downloaded or emailed by a network



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-nb-400" -->
## Worm
![worm](http://img.aws.livestrongcdn.com/ls-article-image-400/cpi.studiod.com/www_livestrong_com/photos.demandstudios.com/getty/article/144/167/476944921_XS.jpg)
- Self-replicating:	yes 
- Population growth: 	positive
- Parasitic: 		no
&nbsp;  

<p class="blankline">&nbsp;</p>

- A stand-alone program that propagates via a network
  - Typically exploiting a security hole
- It does *not* modify an existing binary file



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-nb-400" -->
## Rabbit
![rabbit](http://prod-upp-image-read.ft.com/bf331d1e-f909-11e6-bd4e-68d53499ed71)
- Self-replicating:	yes 
- Population growth: 	zero
- Parasitic: 		no
&nbsp;  

<p class="blankline">&nbsp;</p>

- A rapidly reproducing program  that consumes all of the available computer resources
  - A fork bomb, for example
- Leaves lots of traces, and doesn't accomplish much
  - So they aren't seen very often
- See the [Wikipedia article on "fork bomb"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_bomb) for more



## Some fork bombs
C++, Python, and Bash shell, respectively:
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
int main() {
  while(1) fork();
  return 0;
}
```

```
import os
while(1):
    os.fork()
```

```
#!/bin/bash
:(){ :|:& };:
```

## Spyware
![spyware](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OdK2rCo-g9s/VGRyT8EwP6I/AAAAAAAAAK0/pSxTUYy699g/s1600/spyware.gif)
- Self-replicating:	no
- Population growth: 	zero
- Parasitic: 		no
&nbsp;  

<p class="blankline">&nbsp;</p>

- Software that collects information from a computer and transmits it to somebody else
  - Usernames and passwords, e-mail addresses, financial information, software license keys, etc.
- Viruses and worms can do similar things
  - Spyware is software that doesn't self replicate



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-nb-400" -->
## Adware
![adware](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/security-adware.jpg)
- Self-replicating:	no 
- Population growth: 	zero
- Parasitic: 		no
&nbsp;  

<p class="blankline">&nbsp;</p>

- Similar to spyware:
  - Gathers information about the user
- But it has differences:
  - It's more marketing-focused (pops up ads, redirects a browser, etc.)



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-500" -->
## Droppers
![dropper](http://res.publicdomainfiles.com/pdf_view/60/13539959411915.png)
- Self-replicating:	n/a
- Population growth: 	n/a
- Parasitic: 		n/a
&nbsp;  

<p class="blankline">&nbsp;</p>

- A dropper is a program that deposits malware on a computer
- Many viruses or worms contain a dropper for a larger piece of malware



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-nb-400" -->
## Hybrids
![hybrid: chimera](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Chimera_d%27arezzo%2C_fi%2C_04.JPG/640px-Chimera_d%27arezzo%2C_fi%2C_04.JPG)
- Self-replicating:	n/a
- Population growth: 	n/a
- Parasitic: 		n/a
&nbsp;  

<p class="blankline">&nbsp;</p>

- A hybrid is a piece of malware that uses multiple techniques discussed here
- Hybrid example: Ken Thompson's UNIX back door
  - Was a Trojan horse, replicated like a virus, created back doors
- Most malware today is hybrids



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-nb-400" -->
## Zombies
![zombies](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Zombie_haiti_ill_artlibre_jnl.png/434px-Zombie_haiti_ill_artlibre_jnl.png)
- Self-replicating:	?
- Population growth: 	?
- Parasitic: 		yes (to a computer)
&nbsp;  

<p class="blankline">&nbsp;</p>

- A zombie is a computer that somebody else can (partially) control
  - Often Windows machines
  - Can send spam, perform DoS attacks
  - User is often unaware of the zombie
- A zombie is often a drop of another piece of malware



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-500" -->
## Botnet
![botnet](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Botnet2.gif/640px-Botnet2.gif)

- Example: [Bredolab botnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bredolab_botnet)
  - Dismantled in 2010, but controlled 30 *million* computers at it's peak
  - Owner(s) made over $100k per month



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-nb-400" -->
## Ransomware
![ransomware](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Ransomware-pic.jpg/640px-Ransomware-pic.jpg)
- Very common these days
  - It usually is the payload of<br>another attack
- It requires one to pay to<br>"release" resources


- Stats ([source](http://www.businessinsider.com/doj-and-dhs-ransomware-attacks-government-2016-4)) from an April 2015 report:
  - The DOJ received 7,700 public complains in the last decade, totaling $57.6 million paid
    - Generally $200 to $10,000 per "episode"
  - $24 million in 2,500 cases in 2015 alone

# Vulnerabilities Exploited
	  </textarea></section>

	  <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
## What Vulnerabilities Were Exploited?
- "Vulnerability" often refers only to vulnerable code in an OS or applications
  - E.g. Unguarded buffer overflow in OS command allows attacker to run arbitrary command, gain root access, etc.
  - Failure to validate user input
  - Allowing ActiveX controls to be run from scripts
	  </textarea></section>

	  <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
## What Vulnerabilities Were Exploited?
- More generally, a vulnerability is whatever weakness in an overall system that makes it open to attack
  - System administration and configuration flaws
  - Dangerous user behavior
	  </textarea></section>

	  <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
## Code Vulnerabilities
- Buffer overflow is the most common
  - Array bounds not usually checked at run time (Why not?)
- What comes *after* the buffer being overflowed determines what can be attacked
  - Return address can be changed to malicious code
  - Function pointer can point to malicious code
  - Output file name for a program can be overwritten with file name desired by attacker
- Buffer overflows are simple to guard against, yet they remain the most common code vulnerability
	  </textarea></section>

	  <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
## Buffer Overflow Example

```
void bogus(void) {
   int i;
   char buffer[256];      // Return address follows!

   printf("Enter your data as a string.\n");
   scanf("%s", buffer);   // No bounds check!

   process_data(buffer);
   return;

   // Returns to the return address that 
   // follows buffer[] on the stack frame
}
```
When writing beyond the size of `buffer` one will (eventually) overwrite the return address
	  </textarea></section>

	  <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
## Buffer Overflow cont'd.
- Notice that the program does not check to make sure that the user inputs 255 characters or less
- Source code is available for many operating systems and applications
  - OR they can be disassembled and analyzed by the attacker
- Attacker can see that it is possible to overflow the buffer
- Buffer is last data item on the stack frame; the return address from this function will be at a defined distance after it
	  </textarea></section>

	  <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
## Buffer Overflow cont'd.
- Attacker can enter a character string representation of his malicious object code, long enough to fill the buffer
- At the end of the malicious code, the attacker passes the address of variable "buffer" so that it overwrites the return address of function bogus() on the stack frame
- When bogus() returns, it will cause a return to the buffer address, executing the malicious code in it
	  </textarea></section>

	  <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
## User Behavior Vulnerabilities
- Poor password selection
  - Too short; all alphabetic; common words
  - 1988 Morris worm used a list of only 432 common passwords, and succeeded in cracking many user accounts all over the Internet
  - This was the main reason the worm spread more than the creator thought it would; he did not realize that password selection was that bad!
	  </textarea></section>

	  <section data-markdown><textarea data-template>
## User Behavior Vulnerabilities cont'd.
- Opening executable email attachments
  - "This email is from my friend; it must be safe." But, the friend's PC has a virus!
  - Knowing the sender is not enough to make it safe to open
  - Virus creator can disguise the attachment to look like it is not executable
  - Remember the "Love Letter" virus!
- So only open the attachment if you know the sender, right?
  - What could be wrong with that?
