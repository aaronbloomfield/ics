## Computer Virus
- Malware that:
  - Alters an executable file and inserts its own code in there
    - Often a binary executable, but can be a script, batch file, etc.
  - At some point during execution, control is transferred to the virus
    - Or at least the transfer of control is attempted...
  - Often (but not always!) has a *payload*



## Why Windows as a target?
- Most viruses affect Windows -- but why?
- Market share!
  - As of September 2018, Windows has 82% of the market, Mac OS X 13%, Linux 2% ([source](http://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide/))
	- That is home computer share, and does not include, say, Amazon's clusters
	- Android is 25% of all viruses, but that is not included above
- Relative weak security, compared to Linux and Mac OS X
- Main user often has admin access



## Virus arms race
- The loop:
  - Virus writers will develop a creative new way to "hide" from the anti-virus scanners
  - Anti-virus scanners will adapt, and be able to detect the new virus
- Rinse, lather, repeat
- This played out especially in the 1980's and 1990's
  - Nowadays malware has moved on to other infection methods

## Windows PE file format
![PE format](https://mk0resourcesinfm536w.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/112015_2323_2MalwareRes1.jpg)
- Parts:
  - DOS header
  - DOS stub
  - PE header
    - Where Windows<br>looks...
  - PE sections
    - .data section
    - .rdata section
    - .text section

Image from [here](http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/2-malware-researchers-handbook-demystifying-pe-file/#gref)



## Linux ELF Files
<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-800" -->
![ELF file](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Elf-layout--en.svg/693px-Elf-layout--en.svg.png)
- Similar in concept to PE files
  - No DOS header, though!
- Same common sections
  - .data, .text, .rodata, etc.
- Meant as a generic format
  - Runs on Linux, Playstation,<br>many UNIX OSes,<br>Android (sorta), etc.
- Image from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format)



## PE Sections
- .text: Code 
- .data: Initialized data
- .bss: Uninitialized data
- .rdata: Const/read-only (and initialized) data
- .edata: Export descriptors
- .idata: Import descriptors
- .reloc: Relocation table
- .rsrc: Resources (icon, bitmap, dialog, ...)

(shamelessly copied from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19012300/whats-the-difference-between-rdata-and-idata-segments))

## Linking a PE file
![PE file linking](images/viruses/pe-linking.png)
- Compiler produces .o files
- Each .o has its own sections
- Linker combines into the PE
- Linker: the last compiler stage



## Linking a PE file
- Why the dead spaces?
 - Alignment restrictions
  - Perhaps 128 byte boundaries
- Some linkers make PE file align to page boundaries
  - Memory pages are much bigger (1 Kb to 4 Kb)
  - This simplifies the loader's job
  - But makes PE file bigger on disk



## PE file expansion
![PE file expansion](images/viruses/pe-expansion.png)



## PE file expansion
- Why the expansion?
  - Memory will have different alignment restrictions than the file on disk
  - Loader increases dead spaces to use page boundaries, while alignment is to a lesser size (e.g. 128 bytes) in the PE file on disk
  - Page sizes are 1 Kb to 4 Kb
- The OS can place *restrictions* on pages (read-only, no-execute, etc)
- Like unpacking a suitcase...

# Virus Infections

</section>
    
<section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n">
  <textarea data-template>
## File infection modalities
- Beginning of .text section with Destructive Overwrite
- Random Location in .text section with Destructive Overwrite
  - Will not always execute!
- Appending Viruses
- Multiple Techniques
- Cavity Viruses (possibly fractionated)
- Compressing Viruses
- Entry-Point Obscuring (EPO) Viruses
  - Including IAT replacement



## The "tricky jump"
- The most common technique to transfer control to a virus
- Recall that the `ret` assembly command pops an address from the stack and then jumps there
</textarea></section>

<section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n" id="trickyjump">
  <textarea data-template>
## The "tricky jump"
- Insert virus code somewhere
  - At the end, in a cavity, etc.
- Find a suitable `ret` in some subroutine
- Overwrite the last few instructions in that subroutine with:
  - `push [virus code address]`
  - `ret`
- Saved instructions are put into the virus code
  - At the end, prior to the ret
</textarea></section>

<section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n">
  <textarea data-template>
## Detecting a tricky jump
- This is very easy to find!
  - Just look for a `push` followed immediately by a `ret`
    - No compiler would ever compile assembly that does that
- Virus writers got creative:
  - Added a bunch of nops between (`add eax, 0`, etc.)
- Anti-virus researchers figured out how to detect those
- So better stealth was needed...

# Basic Virus Stealth
  </textarea>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n">
  <textarea data-template>
## Viruses must be stealthy
- Otherwise you immediately know something is wrong, and you fix it, removing the virus
- Thus, the virus must:
  - Quickly execute its payload (and possible other infections)
  - Jump back to the "expected" behavior when done



## Entry-Point Obscuring (EPO) Viruses
- An EPO virus obscures its own entry point by finding a call instruction in the targeted PE file and "hijacking" the call so that the virus code is called instead
- Thus, we find a `call` opcode and replace the target with the virus address
- A good EPO virus will save all registers, and then restore them on the way out



## Detecting Call-Hijacking Viruses
- Check if any of the `call` targets are outside the .text section of code
- The .reloc section is examined by modern anti-virus software to see if it looks like a legitimate .reloc section
  - Code patterns such as saving state, tricky jumps, etc., can be detected in the .reloc section



## Calling library functions
- When your binary code calls a library function
  - such as `printf()`, or `<<` on `cout`, etc.
- The program consults the Import Address Table (in Windows)
  - aka the .dynsym section in Linux
  - aka the LC\_DYLD\_INFO section in Mac OS X
- And looks up the address (in the libc library) for `printf()`
- The *loader* patches the address for `printf()` (and other methods) into the IAT when the program starts up



## EPO Viruses: IAT Replacement
- A virus can change the address in the IAT to that of the virus code
  - It saves the "real" address and jumps there when done
- Several function pointers can be saved in the virus body, then replaced with pointers to the virus code
- After the virus code is memory-resident, it can restore the IAT in memory so that the API is preserved and stealth is maintained

# Advanced Virus Stealth
  </textarea>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n">
  <textarea data-template>
## Anti-disassembly techniques
- Prevent a disassembly (i.e., printout) to hinder analysis
- Examples:
  - Encrypt the virus (machine) code (next slide)
  - Obfuscated computation (next next slide)
  - Using checksums (next next next slide)
  - Compressed code (like encrypted viruses)



## Example: Cascade Virus
- The simple decryptor of Cascade, circa 1990:
```
   lea  si,Start ; start of encrypted code 
                 ; (computed by virus)
   mov  sp,0682h ; length of encrypted code (1666 bytes)
Decrypt:
   xor  [si],si  ; xor code with its address
   xor  [si],sp  ; xor code with its inverse index
   inc  si       ; increment address pointer
   dec  sp       ; decrement byte counter
   jnz  Decrypt  ; loop if more bytes to decrypt
Start:         ; virus code body
```
- Note that one of the `xor` commands is xor'ing it with the address, which will change with each infection
  - Thus, pattern matching won't find the code!
  - But pattern matching can find the decryptor...




## Obfuscated Computation
- Example from Szor text, p. 223 (section 6.2.3):
- Straightforward code to write 256 bytes into a file:
```
mov  cx, 100h   ; 100h = 256 bytes to write
mov  ah, 40h    ; 40h = DOS function number
int  21h        ; Invoke DOS handler
```
- Convoluted code to do the same thing:
```
mov  cx, 003Fh  ; cx = 003fh
inc  cx         ; cx = 0040h
xchg ch, cl     ; swap ch, cl (cx = 4000h)
xchg ax, cx     ; swap ax, cx (ax = 4000h)
mov  cx, 0100h  ; cx = 100h
int  21h        ; Invoke DOS handler 
```



## Checksums
- Instead of:
```c
for (each prototype in DLL export table) 
    if (0 == strcmp(name,"GetFileHandle(int)"))
        infect(current export table address);
endfor
```
which has the subroutine name clearly visible, use:
```c
int ConstantName = 0x89f7e5b2; // Computed by virus writer
for (each prototype in DLL export table)
     if (checksum(name) == ConstantName)
        infect(current export table address);
endfor
```




## Anti-debugging techniques
- Prevent tracing the code in a debugger
- Techniques:
  - Hook interrupts 1 and 3 (next slide)
  - Pre-compute a checksum of code, so if it's modified (by a debugger placing an interrupt there), it can choose not to execute
  - Detect debugger changes to the stack (next next slide)
  - Use the stack pointer as a counter for a decryption routine



## Hooking interrupts
- There are interrupts for single-stepping (INT 1) and breakpoints (INT 3)
- A debugger will "register" (aka "hook") the interrupt
  - This means telling the CPU to execute a particular address of code when that interrupt is called
  - It will then *overwrite* the instruction to break at with `INT 3`
    - Once in the handler, the original instruction is restored, and the debugger pauses at a break point



## Hooking interrupts, cont'd
- So a virus can put its code as an *interrupt handler* for either, and then call the interrupt directly
	- The virus won't work under a debugger, then!



## Detecting Stack Changes
- Without single-step debug state changes, a location on the stack will remain unchanged until an instruction changes it
  - But will be changed by the debugger after every instruction during single-step debug
- To detect this:
```
mov rbp,rsp      ; rbp gets current stack pointer
push rax
pop rax          ; old pushed value still at [rbp-8]
                   ;    which is beyond current stack
cmp qword ptr [rbp-8],rax   ; equal if no debugger
jne DEBUG        ; debugger detected! Go abort!
```



## Anti-emulation techniques
- Prevent emulation, either in a full virtual environment (such as VirtualBox) or just a regular emulator
- Techniques:
  - Attempt to throw exceptions
    - Emulators have a hard time determining exactly when an exception will occur
  - Use long idle loops
    - Takes longer in emulators
  - Be a time or logic bomb
    - Won't always work, then!



## Anti-heuristic techniques
- A heuristic is an algorithm for determining if there is a virus
  - Something that can find *if* a virus exists (by a tricky jump, say), if not necessarily the exact virus
- Techniques:
  - EPO viruses
  - Re-arrange PE files so the virus is not "appended" anymore



## Anti-goat techniques
- A goat file (from the concept of sacrificial goats) is a dummy file of known content whose infection will signal the presence of a virus
  - Scattered around the disk in various file types that are prone to infection, e.g. .exe, .vbs, etc.
- Viruses examine files for goat file characteristics:
  - Lots of no-ops and do-nothing instructions
  - Clusters of files with sequential numbers in their names, e.g. abcd0001.vbs, abcd0002.vbs, etc.



## Retroviruses
- Malware that attacks the defenses
  - In biology, that's the immune system, such as what HIV does
  - For computers, that's the anti-virus software
- Techniques:
  - Direct attack on the anti-virus software (rename the executable, kill the process, etc.)
  - Affect the integrity database
  - Deter anti-virus use with a "warning"

# Even More Advanced Virus Stealth
  </textarea>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n">
  <textarea data-template>
## Encrypted viruses
- Encrypted viruses started appearing in the late 1980's
- One could not pattern match on the virus body...
  - ... since part of the encryption was the *address* in the executable, which would vary with each different file infected
- So one had to mutate the *decryptor*
- This was all to prevent pattern matching detection



## Encryptor mutation types
- Three types:
  - Oligomorphic have a pre-set number of different encryptors (say, a few dozen)
  - Polymorphic can permute the encryptor into millions or billions of variations
  - Metamorphic mutate the virus *body* into countless variations
    - Thus, no need for encryption!



## Assembly code permutation
- Add nop instructions: `nop`; `add rax, 0`; `shr rax, 0`; etc.
- Instructions that modify registers that are not used by the code
- Instructions that have a cumulative zero net effect: `inc rax` followed by `sub rax, 1`
- Re-ordering of instructions
- Register replacement



## Oligomorphic viruses
- Memorial was a Windows 95 oligomorphic virus that generated 96 different decryptors, choosing one at replication time
  - Detecting 96 different patterns is an impractical solution for virus scanners that must deal with thousands of viruses; pattern database size explosion would result
- It inserted junk instructions at various points in the decryptor code



## Polymorphic viruses
- First one was in 1990: [V2PX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1260_(computer_virus%29) or 1260 (because it was only 1260 bytes!)
  - Created by an anti-virus researcher as a proof-of-concept
    - Thus, it had no payload
- Instructions were in three groups; within each group the instructions could have any order
- A limited number of junk instructions could be inserted



## The 1260 Virus Decryptor
- One instance of a decryptor:
```x86asm
; Group 1: Prolog instructions
	mov ax,0E9Bh    ; set key 1
	mov di,012Ah    ; offset of virus Start
	mov cx,0571h    ; byte count, used as key 2
; Group 2: Decryption instructions
Decrypt:
	xor [di],cx     ; decrypt first 16-bit word with key 2
	xor [di],ax     ; decrypt first 16-bit word with key 1
; Group 3: Decryption instructions
	inc di          ; move on to next byte
	inc ax          ; slide key 1
; loop instruction (not part of Group 3)
	loop Decrypt    ; slide key 2 and loop back if not zero
; Random padding up to 39 bytes
Start:          ; encrypted virus body starts here
```



## 1260 Permutations
- Group sizes were 3, 2, 2: total of 24 orderings of instructions
- Could choose around a hundred thousand junk instructions
- A limit of about 15 total junk instructions could be placed in 11 locations: several thousand possibilities
- This yields around a billion variants
  - And in only 1260 bytes of (machine) code!



## Mutation Engines
- Creating a polymorphic virus that makes no errors is really hard
  - Especially for the average virus writer
- A few virus writers started creating mutation engines, which can transform an encrypted virus into a polymorphic virus 
- The Dark Avenger mutation engine, also called MtE, was the first such engine (DOS viruses, summer 1991, from Bulgaria)



## Early Metamorphics: Regswap
- A Win 95 metamorphic virus from Dec, 1998
- Metamorphism was only register replacement:
```
pop edx                    pop eax
mov edi,0004h              mov ebx,0004h
mov esi,ebp                mov edx,ebp
mov eax,000Ch              mov edi,000Ch
add edx,0088h              add eax,0088h
mov ebx,[edx]              mov esi,[eax]
mov [esi+eax*4+1118],ebx   mov [edx+edi*4+1118],esi
etc.                       etc.
```
- Not much of an obstacle with wildcards:
<pre class="code">
5<span class="hotpink">A</span> B<span class="hotpink">F</span>04000000            5<span class="hotpink">8</span> B<span class="hotpink">B</span>04000000
</pre>
- Both variants match 5? B?04000000



## Metamorphic Engine Example
- The Evol virus of July, 2000
- Compare different generations, after several generations of evolution:
```
mov  dword ptr [esi],55000000h      ; 1st generation
mov  dword ptr [esi+0004],5151EC8Bh ; 1st generation
```
```
mov edi,55000000h      ;2nd gen., constant not changed
mov dword ptr [esi],edi
pop edi                ; junk
push edx               ; junk
mov dh,40h             ; junk
mov edx,5151EC8Bh      ; constant not changed yet
push ebx               ; junk
mov ebx,edx
mov dword ptr [esi+0004],ebx
```



## Evol Example cont.
- A later generation shows the constant mutation starting:
```
mov ebx,5500000Fh      ; 3rd gen., constant has changed
mov dword ptr [esi],ebx
pop ebx                ; junk
push ecx               ; junk
mov ecx,5FC0000CBh     ; constant has changed
add ecx,F191EBC0h      ; ECX now has original value
mov dword ptr [esi+0004],ecx
```
- As it replicates, the metamorphic engine makes just a few changes each generation, but the AV scanner code patterns change drastically 
- Eventually, all constants will be mutated many times



## Other approaches
- [Zperm](https://www.symantec.com/security-center/writeup/2000-121812-0711-99): lots of jumps, so the reordering can be done easily
- Zmorph: lots of small body-polymorphic subroutines that build the virus on the stack
- [Zmist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zmist): *disassembles* the PE file, inserts its code inside, and then *reassembles* the PE file
  - One of the most complex viruses ever written
- [Simile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simile_(computer_virus%29): benign payload, but had 14,000 lines of the metamorphic engine



## What this led to...
- ... is that people gave up using pattern matching on viruses
- Instead, started using emulation and heuristics

## Anna Kournikova virus
- Most known virus created with the VBSWG virus creation kit
- People executed a AnnaKournikova.jpg.vbs e-mail attachment
  - ... because they wanted to see pictures of [Anna Kournikova](https://www.google.com/search?q=anna+kournikova&safe=on&tbm=isch)
- Which then e-mailed itself out to everybody in their Outlook address box
  - Author, 20-year old Jan de Wit created it, even though he did not know how to write a program



## Why we still study viruses today
- Being as this all happened decades ago
- The techniques used in these viruses is present in modern malware
  - Among many other techniques...
