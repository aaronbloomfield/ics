## OSI model
- "Open Systems Interconnection" model, developed starting in 1977
- Everybody (including may textbooks!) uses the OSI model diagrams (see next slide), and talks about TCP/IP
  - But they are not the same!
  - TCP/IP does not fit perfectly into the OSI model
  - We don't care too much about the differences here, so we'll do that as well
  - See [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model#Comparison_with_TCP.2FIP) for details



## OSI Model
[![OSI model](images/networks/OSI_Model_v1.svg)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:OSI_Model_v1.svg)



<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-800" -->
## Protocol stack: physical layer
[![Ethernet cable](images/networks/ethernet-cable.jpg)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ethernet_cable._SAM.jpg)
- Is charged with getting data<br>from one end of the 'wire'<br>to the other end
- Examples:
  - copper wire
  - fiber optic cable
  - wireless transmission<br>(WiFi, Bluetooth, satellite<br>communication), etc.



## Protocol stack: data link layer
- Is charged with getting one packet of data from one host to another connected host
  - Via the next layer down
- Most common example is Ethernet
  - Other examples: ARP, ISDN, PPP, ATM, FDDI
- Although you may use Ethernet, your data will travel over others to it's destination, including fiber optic
  - Such as ATM and FDDI
[![Ethernet packet](images/networks/ethernet-packet.svg)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ethernet_Type_II_Frame_format.svg)



## Protocol stack: network layer
- Is charged with getting a *single* packet of data from one computer to another (via the next layer down), 'routing' the computer between various nodes
  - This is the routing in 'router'
- In TCP/IP, called the "Internet" or "Internet Protocol" (hence "IP") layer
- Example protocols: IP, ICMP (used for 'ping'), IPsec (for VPNs)



## Internet Protocol (IP)
- This is the TCP/IP version of the OSI network layer
- IPv4 has addresses that are 32 bits: four 8-bit numbers
- IPv6 has addresses that are 128 bits
[![IPv4 header](images/networks/ip-header.png)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:IPv4_header_(1%29.png)



## Protocol stack: transport layer
- Is charged with taking a large piece of data, splitting it into smaller packets, sending each packet to the destination (via the next layer down), and (probably) reassembling it at the destination
  - It will (typically) request a missed packet to be re-sent
  - Will assemble the packets in order
- Example protocols: TCP, UDP



## Transport Control Protocol (TCP)
- This is the TCP/IP version of the OSI transport layer
- TCP will ensure any lost packet is re-sent: used for sending files
- UDP doesn't bother: if a packet doesn't arrive, continue on: used for live streams
[![TCP header](images/networks/tcp-header.png)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:TCP_header.png)



## Protocol stack: session & presentation layers
- Are charged with such tasks as managing network sockets, compressing/encoding/ encrypting the data, etc.
- These layers do not exist in the TCP/IP model!
  - This functionality is included in the TCP/IP application layer
- Example protocols: TLS, SSL, NetBIOS



## Protocol stack: application layer
- Is the top-level protocol used to communicate to the application on the other end
- Example protocols: DHCP, DNS, FTP, HTTP, IMAP, NTP, POP, SMTP, SSH



## More about TCP/IP
- TCP/IP, more accurately called the Internet Protocol Suite, is full *suite* of protocols

## Network device terminology
- Node: any device on a network
- Switch: a node that connects networks on the *data link layer* only
  - Also called a bridge
- Router: a node that connects networks on the *network layer*
- Gateway: a node that connects two networks that (potentially) use different protocols
  - Also translates addresses, etc.
- Firewall: blocks 'bad' traffic (more on this in a few slides)

# Basic Network Security
  </textarea>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n">
  <textarea data-template>
## Firewall
- A firewall prevents unrequested network connections from outside hosts
  - Typically part of a residential 'gateway' or 'router'
  - It isolates the 'inside' network and the 'outside' network
  - If you request data (a http connection), the sent data is then 'requested' data, and is allowed to pass through
  - You can 'poke a hole' in a firewall to allow access to a certain port (such as ssh)



## Firewall types
1. Packet filter: removes packets based on the information in their TCP packet (source, destination, port, etc) - can filter out individual hosts this way
2. Circuit-level gateway: forces all data to a given host or network to go through a single gateway, which manages security
3. Application-level gateway: only allows specific application-level data through (ssh, but not http, for example)



## Firewall types
- Residential 'firewalls' do all three
  - 1 (packet filter) is usually not done by the typical user
  - 2 (circuit-level gateway) is by their very design
  - 3 (application-level gateway) is what most people do when configuring their residential firewalls



## TCP attacks
- Imagine Alice is sending something to Bob
- A host between Alice and Bob, Mallory, can intercept (and potentially discard) these packets
  - Similar to a man-in-the-middle attack
- But to modify the packets, the attacker would have to know the TCP state
  - Starting sequence numbers, port numbers, etc.
  - These are often easily guessable
    - Ports are well-known
    - Sequence numbers are often predictable



## TCP attacks
- If Mallory can guess the state, then s/he can impersonate one or the other (or both), thus hijacking the connection
- Instead of downloading a valid program from a trusted website, instead you are now downloading some type of malware
- How can we prevent this?
  - By keeping anybody from figuring out the state of the TCP connection
  - This state is discernible from the TCP packet headers



## IP Security (IPsec)
- IPsec is a protocol suite designed to allow encryption of IP packets (at the Network level)
  - Other similar ones exist: TLS (Transport Layer Security) does something similar at the Transport level
    - SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is the predecessor to TLS
- Allows for authentication, exchange of cryptographic keys, and encryption/decryption of IP data packets
  - Encryption is via AES



## Virtual Private Network (VPN)
- A firewall differentiates between 'inside' and 'outside' to allow more access to those 'inside'
  - How, then, does a (valid) user have that level of access from the 'outside'?
  - Example: using UVa's library's access for online books and what-not
    - It's allowed on-grounds (technically, for any computer in the virginia.edu domain)
    - But not off-grounds (such as from va-67-76-91-214.dyn.embarqhsd.net)
- The answer: VPNs



## Virtual Private Network (VPN)
- A VPN makes potentially vastly separated IP addresses appear to be a single (virtual) private network
  - Then, the access is provided to that private network
- Keeps one from having to construct one's own private network (expensive)
- It matters not what type of ISP the user is on
- Typically requires a setting or two in a residential 'gateway' (specifically, IPsec)



## Wi-Fi encryption
- This encrypts all data sent over a wireless network
  - This encryption is done at the network or data-link level
  - Application-level encryption (https, ssh, imaps, etc.) is on top of Wi-Fi encryption
- There are two types
  - Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
  - Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2)



## Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
- It does *not* stand for "Wireless Encryption Protocol"
- Created in 1997 to provide confidentiality comparable to that of a traditional wired network
- Security weaknesses were identified in 2001
- In 2003, WEP was replaced by WPA (and, later, WPA2)



## WEP weaknesses
- It uses a stream (aka character) cipher RC4 to encrypt each packet
- RC4 is (essentially) secure, but one weakness is that repeated keys can allow an RC4 encoded message to be cracked
  - There is one RC4 key, and many different initialization vectors or IVs; one IV for each packet



## Encryption without IVs
[![](images/networks/ECB_encryption.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation)



## Encryption with IVs
(at least what should happen)
[![](images/networks/CBC_encryption.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation)



## WEP weaknesses
- WEP uses 24-bit IVs
  - Because of the way the IVs are used, there is a 50% chance of a key being repeated after 5,000 packets
  - This can lead to cracking the RC4 key, and reading all the WEP encrypted data
  - On a busy network, this can happen in under 1 minute



## Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA & WPA2)
- In 2003, it was announced that WEP had been superseded by WPA
- WPA2 followed the following year (2004)
- WPA uses RC4 (character cipher); WPA2 uses AES (block cipher) for the data encryption 
- Corresponds to IEEE standard 802.11 (for WPA) or 802.11i (for WPA2)
- Still considered 'secure' for Wi-Fi encryption



## WPA(2) weaknesses
- Password cracking due to weak passwords
  - Look-up tables exist for a million different WPA/WPA2 passwords
- Brute force attacks can crack moderate passwords
  - A truly random password of 13 characters (from the 95 available) can prevent brute-force attacks

# Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
  </textarea>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown data-separator="^\n\n\n">
  <textarea data-template>
## Denial-of-service (DoS) attack
- A website (or other network resource) attempts to provide a *service* to authorized users
- If one can stop the website or resource, then service is being denied to the proper users
  - Hence the name
- It typically is done via flooding the website or resource with network packets, using up its bandwidth
  - If done from one host, the site can easily packet-filter out that host



## Denial-of-service (DoS) attack
- Thus, it is most often done from many sites
  - This is a *distributed* denial of service (DDoS) attack
  - Often done via a zombie botnet



## DoS attacks: ping flood
- ICMP is protocol on the Network level, along with IP, and is used for the 'ping' command
  - A ping flood attack (can only be run as root on most UNIX systems)
  - It sends as many pings out as the bandwidth can support
  - The (combined) bandwidth of the attacker must be greater than the (combined) bandwidth of the target



## DoS attacks: SYN flood
- In TCP (transport level), a SYN packet starts a 'handshake' to open up a connection
  - Response is an 'ACK' acknowledging the SYN
  - Then another ACK acknowledging the first ACK



## DoS attacks: SYN flood
- A SYN flood attack sends a TCP SYN packet with a forged 'from' field
  - Each SYN packet is treated like a connection request
  - The target site will span a half-open connection, send a ACK, and wait until it (never) arrives
  - This saturates the number of connections the attacked server can make, causing it to be unresponsive to the legitimate users



## DoS attacks: reflected attack
- Instead of forging a non-existent source address, make the source be the target machine
- Then, when the target sends a reply (which is automatically done with many types of network datagrams), it goes back to the target, using up their bandwidth a second time



## DoS attacks: teardrop attacks
- Sending mangled IP fragments with overlapping, over-sized payloads to the target
- Due to a bug in the TCP/IP fragmentation re-assembly code, this would crash the operating system
  - This bug has long since been patched (in 1999/2000), but was existent on Windows 3.1x, 95, and NT, as well as Linux versions prior to 2.0.32 and 2.1.63
- This means that just sending a "bad" network packet to a computer would crash that computer!



## DoS attacks: brute force
- Not very elegant, but very effective
- Just flood the machine with requests, such as http GET
- This does not require much knowledge, just access to a lot of computers
  - Probably via a zombie botnet
