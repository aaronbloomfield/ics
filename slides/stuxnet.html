## Definition: PLC
- PLC: Programmable Logic Controller
 - A "computer used for automation of electromechanical processes"
  - Typically used in assembly lines, amusement rides, light fixtures, etc.
  - Often has many more inputs and outputs than a typical PC might have
  - Often hardened against the environment (dust, water, vibration, etc.)
  - Programmed via a PL on a PC, then the program is transferred over to the PLC


## Definition: SCADA
- Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition
- A industrial control system to monitor some industrial process (such as uranium enrichment)
- Components:
  - A human-machine interface for human monitoring
  - Supervisory computer control system
  - Sensors and actuators
  - PLCs that are between the sensors and actuators
  - Etc.


## Uranium enrichment
- Uranium comes in six isotopes, two of which we care about for this lecture:
  - Uranium 238: 99.27%
  - Uranium 235: 0.71%
- While all are radioactive, and all are unstable, U-235 is the most usable in nuclear (fission) reactions
- A typical nuclear reactor requires 3.5% U-235 to sustain a reaction
	- A nuclear weapon requires 90% U-235
- But the isotopes are intermixed; how to separate them?


## Uranium enrichment
- After the uranium is mined, it is converted into a gas: uranium hexafluoride (UF$_6$)
  - (well, it's gas at 134 degrees Fahrenheit)
- The UF$_6$ is then put into a centrifuge, and spun around at high speeds
	- The heavier U-238 moves to the outside, the lighter U-235 moves to the inside
- This is done repeatedly until the appropriate concentration of U-235 is reached

## Peaceful uranium enrichment?
- The technology to produce weapons-grade uranium is the same as to produce reactor-grade uranium
  - It just takes a LOT more money and time (and produces much more waste)
- One of the jobs of the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) - a UN organization - is to monitor countries to ensure that they are enriching uranium for peaceful means
  - I.e., only to a 3.5% U-235 concentration


## Political background
- These slides are meant as a neutral but honest assessment, and is not taking a stand one way or the other
- Recently, many countries have been trying to develop "the bomb"
  - ~~North Korea~~, Iran, ~~Pakistan~~, ~~India~~, etc.


## Political background
- Iran and North Korea (DPRK) are considered to being "close" to achieving this
  - (DPRK has it, depending on your definition)
  - And they have repeatedly threatened the US (and, in Iran's case, Israel, a close US ally)
  - And the US doesn't have any (direct) diplomatic relations with either them
	- And they have rebuffed IAEA monitoring (although Iran allowed some in rather recently)


## Iran's nuclear program
- Started in the 1950's, it had significant US assistance until the 1979 Iranian revolution
- Primary uranium enrichment facility is at Natanz
- The first nuclear reactor went online in September 2011
  - The reactor was built with Russian assistance
- Iran has "undertaken research and experiments geared to developing a nuclear weapons capability"
	- From an IAEA report in November 2011


## Zero-day exploit
- A zero-day attack is an exploit against some system that:
	- Is unknown to many, possibly including the developer
    - Typically has no patch available to fix the vulnerability
- Note that this is an *exploit*, not just a *vulnerability*
- You can *easily* fetch a million dollars on the black market for such an exploit
- Term etymology is because it occurs "on or before the zeroth day of developer awareness"

# Overview
	  </textarea></section>
	  
	  <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n$"><textarea data-template>
## Overview
- Stuxnet infected the computers in Iran that controlled the uranium centrifuges
  - It recorded what a "proper" reading would be
  - Then caused them to spin out of control
- This caused significant damage to Iran's ability to enrich uranium
- First identified in June 2010, it was estimated that it started spreading in March or April of 2010
  - 1.5 years before Iran's first nuclear reactor went online


## Target
- Stuxnet had little affect on systems that were not running Siemen's SCADA software for uranium enrichment
	- It would try to propagate a certain number of times (3), and then become inert
- And it only did anything malicious on systems with the VERY specific configuration that Iran's systems used
- The target seemed to have been Iran's uranium enrichment facility at Natanz


## Four (4!) Windows zero-day attacks!
- There were FOUR separate zero-day attacks against Windows
	- Plus two vulnerabilities that were already known, but not everybody had patched against
	- Using four was unprecedented
	- Malware writers typically will only use one at a time


## Rootkit capability, take 1
- After using one of the 6 exploits...
  - The 4 zero-day attacks or the 2 known attacks...
- ... it installs both a kernel-level and application-level rootkit on Windows
  - The device drivers have been digitally signed with stolen certificates from real companies in Taiwan
	- Those two certificates have since been revoked by Verisign


## Rootkit capability, take 2
- The Siemens SCADA system used for uranium enrichment used PLCs
- And Stuxnet contained a rootkit for these PLCs
  - But only PLCs from two vendors: a Finnish company and an Iranian company
- These PLCs are used to control the speed of the motors of the centrifuges
- The rootkit does the actual changing of the motor speeds


## Windows <-> PLC communication
- Stuxnet subverts the DLL that is used to communicate with the PLCs
  - This was done through yet another zero-day exploit on the SCADA software (a hard-coded DB password)
- This modified DLL allows the reprogramming of the PLC (with the PLC rootkit) without detection by any of the other security software


## Man-in-the-middle attack
- Stuxnet modified the PLC communication DLL
- And then installed a rootkit on the PLCs
- This was thus a man-in-the-middle attack
  - And this complexity is "unusual" for malware


## Metamorphism
- And it mutates, as well!
- Little information is available on this, but my best guess is that it is metamorphic (i.e., body polymorphic)
  - That capability was available over a decade ago
  - And it's not like the creators lacked technical ability...


## How to classify Stuxnet?
- It's a worm (one of the ways it spreads)
- It has viral infection capabilities (when it infects the PLC communication DLL)
- It was two rootkits (against Windows and the PLC)

## Identification
- Stuxnet took longer to identify than almost any other piece of malware
  - Meaning once they started analyzing it
  - Partly due to the necessity to have the Siemens hardware to fully analyze it
- Even today, its full capabilities are not fully understood


## Countries affected
- Iran: 		59.8%
- Indonesia:	18.2%
- India:		8.3%
- Azerbaijan:	2.6%
- United States:	1.6%
- Pakistan:	1.3%
- Others:		9.2%


## Stuxnet firsts...
- Use of 4 zero-day exploits on Windows
- A rootkit against a PLC
- Attacking SCADA software
- Causing this much physical damage
- Being anything remotely this complex


## Effects on Iran
- Shutdown the centrifuges at Natanz for a time
- Over the course of a year, the output from Natanz was decreased by 30%
  - And was up again the next year, but not to full production capacity
- Destroyed 1,000 centrifuges
  - But Iran had at least 5,000 there
  - Why did it destroy so few?  Nobody knows...
- Obviously embarrassment for Iran
- But it probably only delayed their enrichment goals by a year (or two, at most)


## Whodunit?
- Pretty much everybody agrees that this was only done "with nation-state support"
- The US and Israel are the top of the speculation list
  - As they had the most reason to want to derail Iran's nuclear program (and have been trying for some time)
  - Many think it was a joint effort between the two


## Whodunit?
- A [Wired article](https://www.wired.com/2013/06/general-keith-alexander-cyberwar/all/) from 2013 claims it was a joint effort between the NSA, CIA, and Israeli intelligence
- [Snowden claimed this also](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/07/08/snowden_us_israel_stuxnet/) in 2013
- But of course nothing has been (formally) admitted


## Final Stuxnet notes...
- It deletes itself on June 24, 2012
- Not sure why...
- It is a very LARGE piece of malware:  1/2 Mb

# Aftermath
	  </textarea></section>
	  
	  <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n$"><textarea data-template>
## Duqu
- Symantec: "nearly identical to Stuxnet, but with a completely different purpose"
  - Symantec claims it was built by the same author or by somebody with access to the Stuxnet source code


## Similarities with Stuxnet
- The installer exploits zero-day Windows kernel vulnerability(ies)
- Components are signed with stolen digital keys
- Duqu and Stuxnet are both highly targeted and related to the nuclear program of Iran


## Zero-day exploit
- It used a zero-day exploit in Microsoft Word
  - In the TrueType font parsing engine that allows arbitrary code execution (probably a buffer overflow)
- This came in the form of a MS Word (.doc) file!


## Purpose
- Apparently it's to capture information, such as digital certificates
- It removes itself after 36 days, this limiting the ability to detect it
- The full capabilities of Duqu are not yet known, either


## Flame
- Malware from 2012; most sophisticated at the time
- Many "modules" for the various "features" of the malware
- Customizes its behavior based on the anti-virus software installed
- Mostly information gathering payloads
