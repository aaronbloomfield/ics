Introduction to Cybersecurity (ICS)
===================================

Overview
--------

This repository contains the materials for an Introduction to Cybersecurity (ICS) course at the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu).  It is being taught at UVa for the first time in the fall 2018 semester, so the content of this repo will be filled in as the semester progresses.  The content can be viewed online at [http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/ics](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/ics).

Students *currently* in the course should view the [uva/index.html](uva/index.html) ([md](uva/index.md)) file in the **cloned** repository (i.e., don't try to view it on github.com); current students may also want to view the [daily announcements](uva/daily-announcements.html#/).  Note that many of the course materials are modified right before they are needed -- for example, this repository will be updated right before the semester starts.

The primary author of this repository is [Aaron Bloomfield](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~asb) ([aaron@virginia.edu](<mailto:aaron@virginia.edu>)). Many of the materials were taken, with permission, from other sources -- see the [license page](license.html) ([md](license.md)) for details.
