    - This is from the github repo at [https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/ics](https://github.com/aaronbloomfield/ics){target="_blank"}
    - The [daily announcements](https://aaronbloomfield.github.io/ics/uva/daily-announcements.html#/){target="_blank"}
- Class meetings
  - Lecture discussions are generally 10:30-11:00 (or so) via [this Zoom meeting](https://virginia.zoom.us/j/92129121313?pwd=VHFydFdtNjJYTVF1czBPMHlud244Zz09){target="_blank"} (meeting ID 921 2912 1313, passcode 509755)

    - They have to end just before 10:30 so I can start the 10:30 lecture on time
	- These office hours will start a bit earlier later in the semester as demand necessitates
	- There will also be office hours at other times as needed
  - If you want to view the recordings from the lecture sessions, click on the "Lecture Capture" tool, then on the "Cloud Recordings" tab, then the particular one you want to view.  You can view the full recording or the audio only -- when you click on the icon, it will copy the passcode to the clipboard, and you can then paste that in the box when prompted.
- Everybody has to (digitally) sign the [Cybersecurity Ethics Pledge](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScLvbH611z9dTpPnAfCTQ4u_aX3SJA30M4EutFDOLkuWeArTg/viewform){target="_blank"}
- The VirtualBox image can be found [here](https://virginia.box.com/s/qucmutlc8zy9ouymm62miw0da34ted7e){target="_blank"}; it's about a 5.3 Gb download.
