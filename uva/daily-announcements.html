  - [HW 3: Ethics](../hws/hw-ethics.html), due yesterday: no late penalty for those who submit it by the time today's class starts
  - [HW 4: RSA](../hws/hw-rsa.html) is due Friday (do we want a different due date/time?)
    - How many would rather not do it in Java?
  - HW 5 (SQL/XSS/CSRF) will be due next Tuesday (not yet ready)
- Grades!
  - HW 1 (Rational Paranoia) is graded & returned in Gradescope

    - Some future ones will be in the Posted Feedback tool in Collab
  - Regrades: speak to me (in person!) within a week of when it is returned
- Readings
  - Due today: [An Introduction to Cybersecurity Ethics](https://www.scu.edu/media/ethics-center/technology-ethics/IntroToCybersecurityEthics.pdf): you can skip the questions (the blue boxes therein); once you remove those, the table of contents, and the appendices, it's about 35 typed pages
    - Due to a typo on my part with the due date, I'm going to assume it's due tomorrow instead
  - Due Monday, June 6th: [NPR's Planet Monday episode 908: I Am Not A Robot](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2019/04/24/716854013/episode-908-i-am-not-a-robot) (it's a 25 minute podcast)

  - We have one more person left to sign it...
- Lecture: today we will start on [networking](../slides/networks.html#/), followed by [web security](../slides/web-security.html#/)
  - I'm going much faster than anticipated through the lecture material...
