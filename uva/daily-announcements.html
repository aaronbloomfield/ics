## Tomrrow's midterm

- Remember that we have an [exams](../exams/index.html) page in the repo
  - But I don't have answer keys
- I will NOT be having office hours tomorrow morning
- I'll start out at 10:30 by quickly going through the daily announcements
- Which means the exam will likely start around 10:35 am
- It will be via Google forms
- There is a time limit on the exam, and you will need to submit it by the time it is due
  - That time will be made quite clear when it starts -- likely an hour, but that is not yet set
  - If you have SDAC accommodations for extended time, then you have to submit it by when your extended time runs out
- It is open notes, but closed Internet and closed other-human
- Topic coverage is through all of encryption, and the recent slides on web security
  - But the web security slides will be ligher in terms of coverage
