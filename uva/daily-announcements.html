## Regrades
- All programming assignments are auto-graded; written "things" (exams, quizzes, a few HWs) are not
  - You can submit a regrade for:
    - An auto-grader failure
    - A genuine mis-understanding of the assignment due to poor wording by us
    - A set of auto-grader tests that you do not think were fair
  - You cannot submit a regrade for:
    - Getting it wrong
    - Wanting more points
    - Your dog eating your homework
  - To do so, submit a support request within *1 week* of when it's returned
    - If you do it 8 days later, I'm probably not going to care
    - But 2 weeks later?  No dice
    - In the support request, explain why you feel you should get more points
- Written "things" (exams, quizzes, some HWs)
  - Gradescope will allow you to submit a regrade within about 1 week
  - You have to explain why yours was not graded as per the rubric
- Regrade requests are typically handled at the *very end of the semester*
