<h1 id="cs-3710-course-grades">CS 3710: Course grades</h1>
<p>As per the <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a> (<a
href="syllabus.md">md</a>), the grades were computed by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programming and written assignments (45%)</li>
<li>Two midterms (15% each)</li>
<li>Final exam (25%)</li>
<li>Class participation, pop quizzes (5%)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fall-2019-final-course-grades">Fall 2019 Final Course
Grades</h2>
<p>The participation grade was a combination of four values: the two
quizzes, attendance at Jason Belford’s talk, and a pop attendance quiz
on 11/15. The first three were out of 10 points each, the last out of 5.
That means the participation grade was out of 35 points total. This is a
few too few things to really judge participation, so it wascompensated
by raising the course curve to 7 points (instead of the promised 5 point
mentioned previously). Note that this curve includes the 0.5 points for
rounding, so you don’t get to round again. So if you add 7 points to
your course average (as per the course gradebook), and look that up on
the decade curve (80-83 is a B-, 83-37 a B, 87-90 a B+, and similarly
for the other decades), then that’s your final grade. Note that the A+
range is a it different, as it’s a percentage of the class (the top 4
averages).</p>
