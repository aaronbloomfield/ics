CS 3710: Course grades
======================

As per the [syllabus](syllabus.html) ([md](syllabus.md)), the grades were computed by:

- Programming and written assignments (45%)
- Two midterms (15% each)
- Final exam (25%)
- Class participation, pop quizzes (5%)

## Fall 2019 Final Course Grades

The participation grade was a combination of four values: the two
quizzes, attendance at Jason Belford's talk, and a pop attendance quiz
on 11/15.  The first three were out of 10 points each, the last out
of 5.  That means the participation grade was out of 35 points total.
This is a few too few things to really judge participation, so it
wascompensated by raising the course curve to 7 points (instead of the
promised 5 point mentioned previously).  Note that this curve includes
the 0.5 points for rounding, so you don't get to round again.  So if
you add 7 points to your course average (as per the course gradebook),
and look that up on the decade curve (80-83 is a B-, 83-37 a B, 87-90
a B+, and similarly for the other decades), then that's your final
grade.  Note that the A+ range is a it different, as it's a percentage
of the class (the top 4 averages).
