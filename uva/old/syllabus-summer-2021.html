<p><strong>Course content:</strong> All the course content is available
free online at <a

<p><strong>Online:</strong> This class is going to be completely online
due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The speed of summer classes makes them
tricky to teach fully online. Please provide feedback as the summer term
progresses so I can get a feel for what works and what does not. While
you can always submit a <a
href="https://pegasus.cs.virginia.edu/satori/cs3710-su2021/tickets/">support
ticket</a>, you can also submit <a
href="https://collab.its.virginia.edu/portal/site/6ec853e6-b6e3-40f7-8c72-0f7f966ffa71/tool/f17a5899-fa57-4f82-956f-b24f83d19e6a/main">anonymous
feedback</a> as well.</p>
<p><strong>Lectures:</strong> They will all be via a Zoom meeting, which
you can find in the <a
href="https://collab.its.virginia.edu/portal/site/6ec853e6-b6e3-40f7-8c72-0f7f966ffa71/page/f1237135-a40f-40f6-a89d-a2261bf3bf7c">Online
Meetings tool in the course Collab workspace</a>. While that meeting
repeats every day, we won’t be having office hours or lecture on the
weekends or on Memorial Day (May 25th). Note that you have to be
authenticated, via Collab, before you can join – click on the Online
Meetings tab in the Collab workspace. Lecture attendance is
<strong>REQUIRED</strong>. Office hours are from 10:00-10:30, so the
meeting starts at 10:00, if you want to join early. However, lecture
still starts at 10:30. Most days there will be a short discussion (half
hour or so), and two pre-recorded lecture videos to watch on your own
time – the intent is that you can watch them between by the 12:15 end
time of class if you so choose. The lectures that will not follow this
schedule (just the first half hour being synchronous) are the first one,
the last two, and those of the exams. Note that there will be occasional
pop quizzes in lecture, both on the readings and the lecture videos.
Also note that there are two Saturday classes this year – June 5th and
June 12th. I’m not happy about that, either.</p>
<p><strong>Reading:</strong> Due to the rapidly changing nature of this
topic, there is no assigned textbook – the best textbook on the topic is
already 5-10 years out of date. Readings will consist of handouts,
online materials, and articles (both media and scholarly). Much of the
background for this course depends on completing the readings. Thus,
occasional pop quizzes will happen to ensure that everybody is doing the
reading (and to ensure that people are showing up to class!).</p>
<p><strong>Purchases:</strong> As mentioned above, no textbook is
required for this course. You don’t have to purchase anything for this
course. But you do have to have a relatively modern computer – both for
the course content (online meetings and video) and for VirtualBox (see
Computing Resources, below). I presume that you have a broadband
Internet connection – if not, let me know, and we can work around
that.</p>
<p><strong>Course Description:</strong> This course is meant as a
general introduction to cybersecurity. It will prepare students to take
any of the follow-on cybersecurity courses within the curriculum.</p>
<p><strong>Availability:</strong> It is important to me to be available
to my students, and to address their concerns. If you cannot meet with
me during office hours, e-mail and I will try to find the time to meet.
That being said, like everybody else I am quite busy, so it may take a
day or more to find a time to meet. And if you have any comments on the
course - what is working, what is not working, what can be done better,
etc. - I am very interested in hearing about them. There is an <a
href="https://collab.its.virginia.edu/portal/site/6ec853e6-b6e3-40f7-8c72-0f7f966ffa71/tool/f17a5899-fa57-4f82-956f-b24f83d19e6a/main">anonymous
feedback tool through Collab</a>, or you can send me an e-mail (please
do NOT email the TAs directly). I tend to get bogged down by e-mail as
the semester progresses, so seeing me “in person” (meaning online office
hours) is often a good way to get a more immediate response.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> CS 2150 (Program and Data
Representation) with a grade of C- or above. As per departmental policy,
this pre-req will be checked, and if it is not met, you will be
de-registered from the course. If you are not a UVa student, then you
will need to have: three semesters of programming experience, knowledge
of programming in C or C++, and knowledge of programming in
assembly.</p>
<p><strong>Course objectives:</strong> Students who complete the course
will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the ethical and policy context for cybersecurity in
today’s society</li>
<li>Understand how to better safeguard one’s personal computer</li>
<li>Understand the basics of advanced topics in cybersecurity including
encryption, digital forensics, binary exploits, and networks</li>
<li>Understand the modern concepts in cybersecurity attacks and
prevention</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Grades:</strong> Grades will be calculated by the following
formula:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programming and written assignments (45%)</li>
<li>Midterm (20%)</li>
<li>Final exam (25%)</li>
<li>Class participation, pop quizzes (10%)</li>
</ul>
<p>I <em>expect</em> that grades will follow the standard decade curve:
90 and above is an A of some sort (A-, A, or A+), 80 and above is some
sort of a B, etc. <strong>Note:</strong> I reserve the right to modify
the weighting (changing the curve, adding pop quizzes, etc.), especially
if attendance drops off significantly. In particular, if the grade
averages are very high, then you will need higher than a 90 to get an
A-.</p>
<p><strong>Assignments:</strong> The course content is split into six
“modules”. During a regular (fall or spring) semester, the intent is for
each module to have two assignments: a written homework and a
programming homework. During a summer term, there will be less than
that. The written homeworks will be submitted as a PDF, and will consist
of writing, math, and short programs. The programming assignments will
have their source code submitted. You will need to be familiar with the
<a href="hw-policies.html">homework policies</a> (<a
href="hw-policies.md">md</a>), as you will be bound by them on the
assignments.</p>
<p><strong>Course rules:</strong> You are fully responsible for all
material presented in class and on the required readings. Exams and due
dates are scheduled in advance. A grade of zero will be recorded for
missed exams and late assignments unless prior arrangements are made
(see below for details) or there are truly extenuating circumstances
(which will require appropriate documentation). Assignments turned in
after the due date are penalized 25% per day (or fraction thereof) late;
this means a maximum of 3 days (i.e. 72 hours) late. In most cases, you
are free to develop assignments on any platform/OS you wish. Some
assignments may require a specific operating system setup, which will be
provided when necessary. However, you are responsible for porting your
code to the system the class is using and ensuring that it runs
correctly for us when we grade your assignment. Our reference system
will specified for each assignment, but will generally be Ubuntu Linux.
Some assignments will be graded by automated unit testing.</p>
<p><strong>Disabilities:</strong> The University of Virginia strives to
provide accessibility to all students. If you require an accommodation
to fully access this course, please contact the Student Disability
Access Center (SDAC) at (434) 243-5180 or sdac@virginia.edu. If you are
unsure if you require an accommodation, or to learn more about their
services, you may contact the SDAC at the number above or by visiting
their website at
http://studenthealth.virginia.edu/student-disability-access-center/faculty-staff.</p>
<p><strong>Special Circumstances:</strong> Students with special
circumstances (athletics, extra time required on exams, final exam
conflicts, SDAC considerations, etc.) need to let me know during the
<strong>first week of class</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Exams:</strong> There will be one midterm exam (worth 20% of
the final grade) and one final exam (worth 25% of the final grade).</p>
<ul>
<li>Midterm exam: Saturday, June 5th, during lecture</li>
<li>Final exam: Thursday, Jun 17th, during the normal lecture time</li>
</ul>
<p>Under <strong>NO</strong> circumstances will anybody be allowed to
take the final exam early. You may <strong>ONLY</strong> request to take
the final exam at a different time if you have a final exam
<strong>CONFLICT</strong>, not a busy final exam schedule. Since there
are no other exams scheduled during that time, it is unlikely that you
will have a conflict.</p>
<p><strong>Regrades:</strong> You may submit graded homeworks and exams
for regrading within 4 days of when they are returned to you (less time
for the final due to the end of the semester). Regrades are submitted
via a <a
href="https://pegasus.cs.virginia.edu/satori/cs3710-su2021/tickets/">support
request</a>. As long as people submit responsibly, I will not institute
a frivolous regrade policy that existed in some semesters of CS 2150 (if
one is instituted, you will be told of this ahead of time). This time
limit will be strictly enforced.</p>
<p><strong>Computing resources:</strong> There are two specific computer
resources needed for this course:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to have a working computer that can run a recent build of
<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>, with enough hard
drive space (and memory) to use a course VirtualBox image (about 10 Gb
will be needed for the install, and then 6 Gb will be used once the
installation files are deleted). Any computer made in the last 3 years
will suffice for these requirements, and many older ones will as well.
It doesn’t matter if it’s a desktop or notebook; nor does the speed
matter.
<ul>
<li>If you have an M1 Mac, please let me know, as this will affect what
you can run.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There are a few documents that you may have to print. The total
printing load will be under 10 pages for the entire semester. You will
need to obtain access to a printer for those pages.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Honor pledge:</strong> The UVa Honor Code is in effect for
this course. There are two course specific additions.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>An Ethics Honor Pledge will have to be signed to continue in this
course – see the <a href="../slides/introduction.html#/">course
introduction slide set</a> for details.</li>
<li>You may not look at any other student’s code for ANY reason, period.
Not to debug, not to help, not to learn. You may not let another student
look at <em>your</em> code for any reason. Needless to say, you cannot
copy code from online sources unless the assignment specifically allows
it (and in those cases, you must cite your source). The next paragraph
describes this more.</li>
</ol>
<p>Students are encouraged to discuss programs and assignments in
general. However, helping others find bugs in existing programs, using
another person’s code, or writing code for someone else is cheating and
a violation of the University’s Honor System. Basically, you should not
be looking at another person’s code for <strong>ANY</strong> reason
(obviously you can after BOTH have submitted the assignment, or if there
is a group project). This includes consulting programming solutions to
assignments from previous years. This also includes looking up solutions
online. Any honor violation or cheating will be referred to the honor
committee, and will result in an <em>immediate failure for the
course</em>, regardless of the outcome of the honor trial or your other
grades. No exceptions! I am very strict on this, and one have
successfully raised honor charges against students in the past due to
violations of this policy - and I’ve blocked people from graduation
because of honor offenses.</p>
<p><strong>Your Well Being:</strong> The Engineering School proudly
serves as a safe space for its students and aims to promote their well
being. If you are feeling overwhelmed, stressed, or isolated, there are
many individuals here who are ready and wanting to help. In addition to
the course instructors, you can seek help through the Engineering
Undergraduate office (Thornton A122), or Alex Hall (aec5d, 924-7601) who
is the assistant dean of students for the Engineering school.</p>
<p>Alternatively, there are also other University of Virginia resources
available. The Student Health Center offers Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS) for its students. Call 434-243-5150 (or 434-972-7004 for
after hours and weekend crisis assistance) to get started and schedule
an appointment. If you prefer to speak anonymously and confidentially
over the phone, call Madison House’s HELP Line at any hour of any day:
434-295-8255.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is struggling with gender, sexual, or
domestic violence, there are many community and University of Virginia
resources available. The Office of the Dean of Students, Sexual Assault
Resource Agency (SARA), Shelter for Help in Emergency (SHE), and UVA
Women’s Center are ready and eager to help. Contact the Director of
Sexual and Domestic Violence Services at 434-982-2774.</p>
<p><strong>Topic coverage:</strong> This course will be split into six
different topic areas, which are meant to be a introduction to a
follow-on course that is available (or will soon be available) to take.
Each topic area is expected to take about 6 lectures to cover, and will
have two homeworks. The topic areas are listed below. Note that the
content and the order they are covered may change as the semester
progresses.</p>
<p>As far as the summer term is considered, each day is considered two
“lectures” in the accounting below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction (3.5 lectures); topics: course introduction and
motivation, terminology, security mindset</li>
<li>Ethics &amp; Policy (5 lectures); topics: ethics, policy</li>
<li>Encryption (5.5 lectures); topics: encryption, hashes</li>
<li>Binary manipulation (6 lectures); topics: viruses, buffer overflows,
binary exploits</li>
<li>Networks (6 lectures); topics: networks, web security</li>
<li>Modern topics (9 lectures); topics: SQL/XSS/CSRF, anonymity,
cryptocurrency, stuxnet, rootkits, VMs</li>
<li>Digital forensics (3 lectures); topics: forensics</li>
</ul>
