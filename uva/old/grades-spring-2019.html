<h1 id="cs-3501-course-grades">CS 3501: Course grades</h1>
<p>As per the <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a> (<a
href="syllabus.md">md</a>), the grades were computed by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programming and written assignments (45%)</li>
<li>Two midterms (15% each)</li>
<li>Final exam (20%)</li>
<li>Class participation, pop quizzes (5%)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="participation-quizzes-and-attendance">Participation, quizzes,
and attendance</h3>
<p>I did not give as many quizzes – or take attendance – as many times
as I would have liked. There were only two quizzes, and only one
attendance day, and having so few would cause missing any one (or doing
poorly on any one) to have a particularly large impact. However, the low
number of quizzes was factored into the final course curve (below).
Also, this was worth a relatively small percentage of the course grade
(only 5%). I realize this does not necessarily capture all the ways that
people could have participated in the course.</p>
<h3 id="exam-2-curve">Exam 2 curve</h3>
<p>I overdid it with exam 2, and I said there would be a 20 percentage
point curve. Since exam 2 was worth 15% of the final grade, 20% of that
is 3%. So everybody gets 3 points added to their final course average
because of exam 2.</p>
<h3 id="rounding">Rounding</h3>
<p>Yes, we round grades. Note that <code>round(x) ==
floor(x+0.5)</code>. So we added 0.5 points to everybody’s curve to take
into account rounding. Note that this means rounding is already taken
care of, so if you get an 89.9999999999999999999, it’s still a B+, no
matter how many times you ask - you don’t get to round a second time (in
reality, it was an 89.49 before rounding).</p>
<h3 id="course-curve">Course curve</h3>
<p>The course curve so far was 3.0 points for exam 2. Taking into
account factors such as the grades on the final exam, as well as the
participation from above, I added another 1.5 points to the overall
course curve. This was also to make up for some harder than intended
grading on the homeworks, and to bring the average of the course up a
bit. Thus, the course curve was 4.5 points. With rounding, as discussed
above, that yields a bonus of 5.0 points to one’s average.</p>
<h3 id="course-grades">Course grades</h3>
<p><strong>The overall course got a curve of 4.5 points.</strong> With
rounding, that is an additional <strong>5.0 points</strong> to add to
your final course average. Thus, add 4.5 to your course average from the
<a href="https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/gradebook.php">course
gradebook</a>, and that round that up if necessary. Or add 5.0 to your
course average, and don’t round it.</p>
<p>Rather than add this to everybody’s average, I instead lowered the
course threshold. Whereas the A- threshold is 90.0 (89.5 with rounding),
it was lowered to 85.0 (84.5 with rounding). This is mathematically
equivalent, but far easier to implement.</p>
<p>We followed the standard decade curve, as shown in the table below.
Note that this table does <em>NOT</em> include the course curve of 4.5
(or 5.0) points – it’s just the standard decade table of grades.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">

<tr class="odd">

</tr>
<tr class="even">

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Note that the A+ range range follows a slightly different pattern –
it is the top few students in the class by average, and ended up being
93.0 (98.0 with the course curve) this semester.</p>
