    - There is one piece of evidence that, it will become pretty obvious, I forgot to place, and there is a placeholder in its stead -- you can't use this as an answer to "what did we do wrong" question...
    - And another: Firstname Lastname; you can't mention that one, either
    - Note that autopsy is *already* installed on the VB image!
    - On Tuesday (once we are past the late deadline), I'll realease all the info about what we put on the image via Piazza
- Final exam is 2-5 next Friday (Nov 13) right here in Olsson 120
  - It's cumulative, but will focus more on the most recent material (since the 2nd midterm)
  - I won't be here, since I mis-read my final exam schedule, and will be on a flight to Albuquerque
  - Professor Floryan will drop off the exam and pick it up; Tu (the graduate TA) will be proctoring it
- Grading status
  - Grades for homeworks through HW 7 (Networks), plus HW 9 (Rootkits) and HW 10 (Celebrity Visit) have been returned; regrades open for 10 days
  - Still out to be graded: HW 8 (Cryptocurrency), HW 11 (Buffer Overflow), HW 12 (Movie Night) and shortly HW 13 (Forensics): our goal is to get those all graded by the middle of next week
- The VirtualBox image is ready at https://tinyurl.com/y5y333tp
