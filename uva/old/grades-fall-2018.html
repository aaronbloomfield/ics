<h1 id="cs-3501-course-grades">CS 3501: Course grades</h1>
<p>As per the <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a> (<a href="syllabus.md">md</a>), the grades were computed by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programming and written assignments (35%)</li>
<li>Two midterms (15% each)</li>
<li>Final exam (25%)</li>
<li>Class participation, pop quizzes (10%)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="participation-and-pop-quizzes">Participation and pop quizzes</h2>
<p>I did not give as many quizzes -- or take attendance -- as many times as I would have liked. There were only three quizzes, and only one attendance day, and having so few would cause missing any one (or doing poorly on any one) to have a particularly large impact. So everybody got a base 5/10 for the participation (think of this as like a mini course curve), and the remaining quizzes and attendance day would make up the other 5/10. Note that if you had a valid excuse for missing a quiz or attendance day, then this was taken into account, and the non-free 5 points was computed with this in mind. This is listed as your 'participation' grade in the course gradebook, and was rounded to the nearest 0.01. I realize this does not necessarily capture all the ways that people could have participated in the course.</p>
<h2 id="rounding">Rounding</h2>
<p>Yes, we round grades. Note that <code>round(x) == floor(x+0.5)</code>. So we added 0.5 points to everybody's curve to take into account rounding. Note that this means rounding is already taken care of, so if you get an 89.9999999999999999999, it's still a B+, no matter how many times you ask - you don't get to round a second time (in reality, it was an 89.49).</p>
<h2 id="course-curve">Course curve</h2>
<p><strong>The overall course got a curve of 3.5 points.</strong> With rounding, that is an additional <strong>4.0 points</strong> to add to your final course average. This was to make up for some harsh grading on the exams and homeworks, and to bring the average of the course up a bit. Thus, add 3.5 to your course average from the <a href="https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/gradebook.php">course gradebook</a>, and that round that up if necessary. Or add 4.0 to your course average, and don't round it.</p>
<p>We followed the standard decade curve, as shown in the table below.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">

</table>
<p>Note that the A+ range range follows a slightly different pattern -- it is the top few students in the class by average, and ended up being 98.0 this semester.</p>
