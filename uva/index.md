Readings

All scholarly articles (such as from the ACM digital library) can be obtained from free from any UVa wireless network.  Some of them you will *NOT* be able to get it for free from your home Internet provider such as Comcast (unless you live in a UVa dorm, of course) without using a UVa VPN.  All readings are due by the start of lecture that day.
