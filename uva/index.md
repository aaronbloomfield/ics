All readings are due by the start of lecture that day.

- Due Friday, September 13th:
    - [An Introduction to Cybersecurity Ethics](https://www.scu.edu/media/ethics-center/technology-ethics/IntroToCybersecurityEthics.pdf): you can skip the questions (the blue boxes therein); once you remove those, the table of contents, and the appendices, it's about 35 typed pages
-->

<!--
