Readings

All scholarly articles (such as from the ACM digital library) can be obtained from free from any UVa wireless network.

All readings are due by the start of lecture that day.

- Due Friday, September 13th:
    - [An Introduction to Cybersecurity Ethics](https://www.scu.edu/media/ethics-center/technology-ethics/IntroToCybersecurityEthics.pdf): you can skip the questions (the blue boxes therein); once you remove those, the table of contents, and the appendices, it's about 35 typed pages
